### Definition

Adjectives are words that typically modify nouns and specify their
properties or attributes. They may also function as predicates, as in

_The car is green._

The `ADJ` tag is intended for ordinary adjectives only. See [DET]()
for determiners and [NUM]() for numerals.

Note that there are words that may be traditionally called numerals in
some languages (e.g. Czech) but they are treated as adjectives in our
universal tagging scheme. In particular, _ordinal numerals_ (more
precisely _adjectival_ ordinal numerals, because Czech has also
adverbial ones) behave both morphologically and syntactically as
adjectives and are tagged `ADJ`.

Note that _participles_ are word forms that may share properties and
usage of adjectives and verbs. Depending on language and context, they
may be classified as either [VERB]() or `ADJ`.

### Examples

- _big_
- _old_
- _green_
- _incomprehensible_
- _first, second, third_

	<div property="rdfs:comment">

### Definition

Adposition is a cover term for prepositions and postpositions.
Adpositions belong to a closed set of items that occur before
(preposition) or after (postposition) a complement composed of a noun
phrase, noun, pronoun, or clause that functions as a noun phrase, and
that form a single structure with the complement to express its
grammatical and semantic relation to another unit within a clause.

In many languages, adpositions can take the form of fixed multiword
expressions, such as _in spite of_, _because of_, _thanks to_. The
component words are then still tagged according to their basic use
(_in_ is `ADP`, _spite_ is [NOUN](), etc.) and their status as
multiword expressions are accounted for in the syntactic annotation.

Note that in Germanic languages, some prepositions may also function
as verbal particles, as in _give <b>in</b>_ or _hold <b>on</b>_. They
are still tagged `ADP` and not [PART]().

### Examples

- _in_
- _to_
- _during_

	<div property="rdfs:comment">

### Definition

Adverbs are words that typically modify [verbs](VERB) for such
categories as time, place, direction or manner. They may also modify
[adjectives](ADJ) and other adverbs, as in _<b>very briefly</b>_ or
_<b>arguably</b> wrong_.

There is a closed subclass of _pronominal adverbs_ that refer to
circumstances in context, rather than naming them directly; similarly
to pronouns, these can be categorized as interrogative, relative,
demonstrative etc. Pronominal adverbs also get the `ADV`
part-of-speech tag but they are differentiated by additional features.

Note that in Germanic languages, some adverbs may also function as
verbal particles, as in _write <b>down</b>_ or _end <b>up</b>_.  They
are still tagged `ADV` and not [PART]().

Note that there are words that may be traditionally called numerals in
some languages (e.g. Czech) but they are treated as adverbs in our
universal tagging scheme. In particular, _adverbial ordinal numerals_
([cs] _poprvé_ "for the first time") and _multiplicative numerals_
(e.g. _once, twice_) behave syntactically as adverbs and are tagged
`ADV`.

Note that there are verb forms such as _transgressives_ or _adverbial
participles_ that share properties and usage of adverbs and
verbs. Depending on language and context, they may be classified as
either [VERB]() or `ADV`.

### Examples

- _very_
- _well_
- _exactly_
- _tomorrow_
- _up, down_
- interrogative adverbs: _where, when, how, why_
- demonstrative adverbs: _here, there, now, then_
- indefinite adverbs: _somewhere, sometime, anywhere, anytime_
- totality adverbs: _everywhere, always_
- negative adverbs: _nowhere, never_

	<h2><code property="rdfs:label" lang="">AUX</code>: <div property="rdfs:label">auxiliary verb</div></h2>
	<div property="rdfs:comment">

### Definition

An auxiliary verb is a verb that accompanies the lexical verb of a
verb phrase and expresses grammatical distinctions not carried by the
lexical verb, such as person, number, tense, mood, aspect, and voice.

_Modal verbs_ may count as auxiliaries in some languages (English). In
other languages their behavior is not too different from the [main
verbs](VERB) and they are thus tagged `VERB`. _Copulas_ also stay with
main verbs.

Note that not all languages have grammaticalized auxiliary verbs, and
even where they exist the dividing line between full verbs and
auxiliary verbs can be expected to vary between languages. Exactly
which verbs are counted as `AUX` should be part of the
language-specific documentation.

### Examples

- Tense auxiliaries: _<b>has</b> (done), <b>is</b> (doing), <b>will</b> (do)_
- Passive auxiliaries: _<b>was</b> (done), <b>got</b> (done)_
- Modal auxiliaries: _<b>should</b> (do), <b>must</b> (do)_

### Definition

A coordinating conjunction is a word that links words or larger
constituents without syntactically subordinating one to the other and
expresses a semantic relationship between them.

For _subordinating conjunctions,_ see [SCONJ]().

### Examples

- _and_
- _or_
- _but_

	<div property="rdfs:comment">

### Definition

Determiners are words that modify [nouns](NOUN) or noun phrases and
express the reference of the noun phrase in context. That is, a
determiner may indicate whether the noun is referring to a definite or
indefinite element of a class, to a closer or more distant element, to
an element belonging to a specified person or thing, to a particular
number or quantity, etc.

Note that the `DET` tag includes (pronominal) _quantifiers_ (words
like _many, few, several),_ which are included among determiners in
some languages but may belong to numerals in others. However,
_cardinal numerals_ in the narrow sense _(one, five, hundred)_ are not
tagged `DET` even though some authors would include them in
quantifiers. Cardinal numbers have their own tag [NUM]().

Also note that the notion of determiners is unknown in grammars of
some languages (e.g. Czech); words equivalent to English determiners
may be traditionally classified as [pronouns](PRON) and/or
[numerals](NUM) in these languages. In order to annotate the same
thing the same way across languages, the words satisfying our definition
of determiners should be tagged `DET` in these languages as well.

For instance, [en] _this_ is either pronoun _(I saw <b>this</b>
yesterday.)_ or determiner _(I saw <b>this</b> car yesterday.)_ Its
Czech translation, [cs] _tohle_, is traditionally called pronoun in
Czech grammar, regardless of context. To make the annotation parallel
across languages, it should be now tagged [PRON]() in _<b>Tohle</b>
jsem viděl včera._ and `DET` in _<b>Tohle</b> auto jsem viděl včera._

Usually a nominal allows only one `DET` modifier, but there are occasional cases of _addeterminers_, which appear outside the usual determiner, such as [en] _all_ in _<b>all</b> the children survived_.  In such cases, both _all_ and _the_ are given the POS `DET`.

### Examples

- articles (a closed class indicating definiteness, specificity or givenness): _a, an, the_
- possessive determiners: _my, your, his, her, its, our, their_
- demonstrative determiners: _this_ as in _I saw <b>this</b> car yesterday._
- interrogative determiners: _which_ as in _"<b>Which</b> car do you like?"_
- relative determiners: _which_ as in _"I wonder <b>which</b> car you like."_
- quantity/quantifier determiners: indefinite _any_, universal: _all_, and negative _no_ as in _"We have <b>no</b> cars available."_

	<div property="rdfs:comment">

### Definition

An interjection is a word that is used most often as an exclamation or
part of an exclamation. It typically expresses an emotional reaction,
is not syntactically related to other accompanying expressions, and
may include a combination of sounds not otherwise found in the
language.

Note that words primarily belonging to another part of speech retains
their original category when used in exclamations. For example, _God_
is a [NOUN]() even in exclamatory uses.

As a special case of interjections, we recognize feedback particles
such as _yes_, _no_, _uhuh_, etc.

### Examples

- _psst_
- _ouch_
- _bravo_
- _hello_

### Definition

Nouns are a part of speech typically denoting a person, place, thing,
animal or idea.

The `NOUN` tag is intended for common nouns only. See [PROPN]() for
proper nouns and [PRON]() for pronouns.

Note that some verb forms such as _gerunds_ and _infinitives_ may
share properties and usage of nouns and verbs. Depending on language
and context, they may be classified as either [VERB]() or `NOUN`.

	<div property="rdfs:comment">

### Definition

A numeral is a word, functioning most typically as a determiner,
adjective or pronoun, that expresses a number and a relation to the
number, such as quantity, sequence, frequency or fraction.

Note that cardinal numerals are covered by `NUM` whether they are used
as determiners or not (as in _Windows <b>Seven</b>_) and whether they
are expressed as words _(four)_, digits _(4)_ or Roman numerals
_(IV)_. Other words functioning as determiners (including quantifiers
such as _many_ and _few_) are tagged [DET]().

Note that there are words that may be traditionally called numerals in
some languages (e.g. Czech) but which are not tagged `NUM`. Such
non-cardinal numerals belong to other parts of speech in our universal
tagging scheme, based mainly on syntactic criteria: ordinal numerals
are [adjectives](ADJ) _(first, second, third)_ or [adverbs](ADV) ([cs]
_poprvé_ "for the first time"), multiplicative numerals are adverbs
_(once, twice)_ etc.

### Examples

- _0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 2014, 1000000, 3.14159265359_
- _one, two, three, seventy-seven_
- _I, II, III, IV, V, MMXIV_

	<h2><code property="rdfs:label" lang="">PART</code>: <div property="rdfs:label">particle</div></h2>
	<div property="rdfs:comment">

### Definition

Particles are function words that must be associated with another word
or phrase to impart meaning and that do not satisfy definitions of
other universal parts of speech (e.g. [adpositions](ADP),
[coordinating conjunctions](CONJ), [subordinating conjunctions](SCONJ)
or [auxiliary verbs](AUX)).  Particles may encode grammatical
categories such as negation, mood, tense etc.  Particles are normally
not inflected, although exceptions may occur.

Note that the `PART` tag does not cover so-called _verbal particles_
in Germanic languages, as in _give <b>in</b>_ or _end <b>up</b>_.
These are adpositions or adverbs by origin and are tagged accordingly
[ADP]() or [ADV]().  Separable verb prefixes in German are treated
analogically.

Note that not all function words that are traditionally called
particles in Japanese automatically qualify for the `PART` tag.  Some
of them do, e.g. the question particle か / _ka._ Others (e.g. に /
_ni,_ の / _no_) are parallel to adpositions in other languages and
should thus be tagged [ADP]().

### Examples

- Possessive marker: [en] _'s_
- Negation particle: [en] _not;_ [de] _nicht_
- Question particle: [ja] か / _ka_ (adding this particle to the end of a clause turns the clause into a question); [tr] _mu_
- Sentence modality: [cs] _ať, kéž, nechť_ (_Let's_ do it! _If only_ I could do it over. _May you_ have an enjoyable stay!)
- Indeclinable aspectual or tense particles: [zh] 了 / _le_

	<div property="rdfs:comment">

### Definition

Pronouns are words that substitute for [nouns](NOUN) or noun phrases,
whose meaning is recoverable from the linguistic or extralinguistic
context.

Pronouns under this definition function like nouns. Note that some
languages traditionally extend the term _pronoun_ to words that
substitute for [adjectives](ADJ). Such words are not tagged `PRON`
under our universal scheme. They are tagged as [determiners](DET) in
order to annotate the same thing the same way across languages.

For instance, [en] _this_ is either pronoun _(I saw <b>this</b>
yesterday.)_ or determiner _(I saw <b>this</b> car yesterday.)_ Its
Czech translation, [cs] _tohle_, is traditionally called pronoun in
Czech grammar, regardless of context (the notion of determiners does
not exist in Czech grammar). To make the annotation parallel across
languages, it should be now tagged `PRON` in _<b>Tohle</b> jsem viděl
včera._ and `DET` in _<b>Tohle</b> auto jsem viděl včera._

### Examples

- personal pronouns: _I, you, he, she, it, we, they_
- reflexive pronouns: _myself, yourself, himself, herself, itself, ourselves, yourselves, theirselves_
- demonstrative pronouns: _this_ as in _I saw <b>this</b> yesterday._
- interrogative pronouns: _who, what_ as in _<b>What</b> do you think?_
- relative pronouns: _who, what_ as in _I wonder <b>what</b> you think._ (Note, however, that some relative clause introducing words, such as [en] _that_ are better analyzed as subordinating conjunctions (otherwise known as "complementizers" in the literature), and so are tagged as [SCONJ]().)
- indefinite pronouns: _somebody, something, anybody, anything_
- totality pronouns: _everybody, everything_
- negative pronouns: _nobody, nothing_

	<h2><code property="rdfs:label" lang="">PROPN</code>: <div property="rdfs:label">proper noun</div></h2>
	<div property="rdfs:comment">

### Definition

A proper noun is a noun (or nominal content word) that is the name (or
part of the name) of a specific individual, place, or object.

Note that `PROPN` is only used for the subclass of nouns that are used
as names and that often exhibit special syntactic properties (such as
occurring without an article in the singular in English). When other
phrases or sentences are used as names, the component words retain
their original tags. For example, in _Cat on a Hot Tin Roof_, _Cat_ is
[NOUN](), _on_ is [ADP](), _a_ is [DET](), etc.

A fine point is that it is not uncommon to regard words that are
etymologically adjectives or participles as proper nouns when they
appear as part of a multiword name that overall functions like a
proper noun, for example in _the Yellow Pages_, _United Airlines_ or
_Thrall Manufacturing Company_.  This is certainly the practice for
the English Penn Treebank tag set.

Acronyms of proper nouns, such as _UN_ and _NATO_, should be tagged `PROPN`.
Even if they contain numbers (as in various product names), they are tagged `PROPN` and not [SYM]():
_130XE_, _DC10_, _DC-10_.
However, if the token consists entirely of digits (like _7_ in _Windows 7_), it is tagged [NUM]().

- _Mary_, _John_
- _London_
- _NATO_, _HBO_

Punctuation is not taken to include logograms such as _$_, _%_, and
_§_, which are instead tagged as [SYM]().

### Examples

- Period: _<b>.</b>_
- Comma: _<b>,</b>_
- Parentheses: _<b>()</b>_

### Definition

A subordinating conjunction is a conjunction that links constructions
by making one of them a constituent of the other. The subordinating
conjunction typically marks the incorporated constituent which has the
status of a (subordinate) clause.

We follow [Loos et al. 2003](http://www-01.sil.org/linguistics/GlossaryOfLinguisticTerms/WhatIsASubordinatingConjunctio.htm) in recognizing these three subclasses as subordinating conjunctions:

* Complementizers, like [en] _that_ or _if_
* Adverbial clause introducers, like [en] _when_, _since_, or _before_ (when introducing a clause not a nominal)
* Relativizers, like [he] _še_. (Note that these words, which simply introduce a relative caluse, and normally don't inflect, need to be distinguished from relative or resumptive pronouns, which have a nominal function within the relative clause and which we analyze as [PRON]().)

For _coordinating conjunctions,_ see [CONJ]().

### Examples

- _that_ as in _I believe <b>that</b> he will come._
- _if_
- _while_

### Definition

A symbol is a word-like entity that differs from ordinary words by
form, function, or both.

Many symbols are or contain special non-alphanumeric characters,
similarly to [punctuation](PUNCT).  What makes them different from
punctuation is that they can be substituted by normal words.  This
involves all currency symbols, e.g. _$ 75_ is identical to
_seventy-five dollars_.

Mathematical operators form another group of symbols.

Another group of symbols is emoticons and emoji.

Strings that consists entirely of alphanumeric characters are not
symbols but they may be [proper nouns](PROPN): _130XE_, _DC10_; others
may be tagged `PROPN` (rather than `SYM`) even if they contain special
characters: _DC-10_. Similarly, abbreviations for single words are not symbols but are assigned the part of speech of the full form. For example, _Mr._ (mister), _kg_ (kilogram), _km_ (kilometer), _Dr_ (Doctor) should be tagged [nouns](NOUN). Acronyms for proper names such as _UN_ and _NATO_ should be tagged as [proper nouns](PROPN).

Characters used as bullets in itemized lists _(•, ‣)_ are not symbols,
they are punctuation.

- _+, −, ×, ÷, =, &lt;, &gt;_

### Definition

A verb is a member of the syntactic class of words that typically
signal events and actions, can constitute a minimal predicate in a
clause, and govern the number and types of other constituents which
may occur in the clause. Verbs are often associated with grammatical
categories like tense, mood, aspect and voice, which can either be
expressed inflectionally or using auxilliary verbs or particles.

Note that the `VERB` tag covers main verbs _(content verbs)_ and
_copulas_ but it does not cover _auxiliary verbs,_ for which there is
the [AUX]() tag. _Modal verbs_ may be considered `VERB` or `AUX`,
depending on their behavior in the given language. Language-specific
documentation should specify which verbs are tagged `AUX` in which
contexts.

Note that _participles_ are word forms that may share properties and
usage of adjectives and verbs. Depending on language and context, they
may be classified as either `VERB` or [ADJ]().

Note that some verb forms such as _gerunds_ and _infinitives_ may
share properties and usage of nouns and verbs. Depending on language
and context, they may be classified as either `VERB` or [NOUN]().

Note that there are verb forms such as _transgressives_ or _adverbial
participles_ that share properties and usage of adverbs and
verbs. Depending on language and context, they may be classified as
either `VERB` or [ADV]().

### Examples

- _run, eat_
- _runs, ate_
- _running, eating_

### Definition

The tag `X` is used for words that for some reason cannot be assigned
a real part-of-speech category.

A special usage of `X` is for cases of code-switching where it is not
possible (or meaningful) to analyze the intervening language
grammatically (and where the dependency relation _foreign_ is
typically used in the syntactic analysis).  This usage does not extend
to ordinary loan words which should be assigned a normal
part-of-speech. For example, in _he put on a large sombrero_,
_sombrero_ is an ordinary [NOUN]().

### Examples

- _And then he just <b>xfgh pdl jklw</b>_
