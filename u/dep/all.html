	<h2><code property="rdfs:label" lang="">acl</code>: <div property="rdfs:label">clausal modifier of noun (adjectival clause)</div></h2>
	<div property="rdfs:comment">

`acl` stands for finite and non-finite clauses that modify a nominal.  The `acl` relation 
contrasts with the [advcl]() relation, which is used for adverbial clauses
that modify a predicate. The head of the `acl` relation is the noun
that is modified, and the dependent is the head of the clause that
modifies the noun.

~~~ sdparse
the issues as he sees them
acl(issues, sees)
~~~

~~~ sdparse
Cette affaire Ã  suivre \n This case to follow 
acl(affaire, suivre)
~~~

This relation is also used for optional depictives. The adjective is taken to modify the nominal of which it provides a secondary predication. See [xcomp]() for further discussion of resultatives and depictives.

~~~ sdparse
She entered the room sad
acl(She, sad)
~~~

~~~ sdparse
He painted the model naked
acl(model, naked)
~~~

A relative clause is an instance of `acl`, characterized by finiteness and usually omission of 
the modified noun in the embedded clause. Some languages use a language-particular subtype for the traditional class of relative clauses.

~~~ sdparse
I saw the man you love
acl(man, love)
~~~

Some languages allow finite clausal complements for nouns with 
a subset of nouns like *fact* or *report*. These look roughly like relative clauses, but do not have any omitted role in the dependent clause. This is the class of "content
clauses" in Huddleston and Pullum 2002). These are also analyzed as `acl`.

~~~ sdparse

An adverbial clause modifier is a clause which modifies a verb or other predicate (adjective, etc.),
as a modifier not as a core complement. This includes things such as a temporal clause, consequence, conditional clause, purpose
clause, etc. The dependent must be clausal (or else it is an [advmod]()) and the dependent is the main predicate of the clause.

An adverbial modifier of a word is a (non-clausal) [adverb](u-pos/ADV)
or adverbial phrase that serves to modify the meaning of the word.

Note that in some grammatical traditions, the term _adverbial modifier_ covers
constituents that function like adverbs regardless whether they are realized
by adverbs, adpositional phrases, or nouns in particular morphological 
[cases](u-feat/Case).
We differentiate adverbials realized as adverbs _(advmod)_ and
adverbials realized by noun phrases or adpositional phrases
([nmod]()).

	<h2><code property="rdfs:label" lang="">appos</code>: <div property="rdfs:label">appositional modifier</div></h2>
	<div property="rdfs:comment">

An appositional modifier of a noun is a nominal immediately following
the first noun that serves to define or modify that noun. It includes
parenthesized examples, as well as defining abbreviations in one of
these structures.

~~~ sdparse
Sam , my brother , arrived
appos(Sam-1, brother-4)
~~~

~~~ sdparse
Bill ( John 's cousin )
appos(Bill-1, cousin-5)
~~~

~~~ sdparse
The Australian Broadcasting Corporation ( ABC )
appos(Corporation-4, ABC-6)
~~~

In case of more than one appositive nominal, all nouns should be marked as modifying the first noun, rather than being chained:

~~~ sdparse
Sam , my brother , John 's cousin , arrived
appos(Sam-1, brother-4)
appos(Sam-1, cousin-8)
~~~

Note however that nested apposition cannot be completely excluded. It may occur in combination with coordination:

~~~ sdparse
You can choose between four subjects : language ( German or French ) , economy , technology and art .
appos(subjects, language)
conj(language, economy)
conj(language, technology)
conj(language, art)
cc(language, and)
appos(language, German)
conj(German, French)
cc(German, or)
~~~

*appos* is also used to link key-value pairs in addresses, signatures, etc. (see also the [list]() label):

~~~ sdparse

An auxiliary of a clause is a [non-main verb](u-pos/AUX) of the
clause, e.g., a modal auxiliary, or a form of _be, do_ or _have_ in a

[voice](u-feat/Voice) is not labeled `aux` but [auxpass]().

	<h2><code property="rdfs:label" lang="">case</code>: <div property="rdfs:label">case marking</div></h2>
	<div property="rdfs:comment">

The `case` relation is used for any case-marking element which is treated as a separate syntactic word (including prepositions, postpositions, and clitic case markers). Case-marking elements are treated as dependents of the noun or clause they attach to or introduce. (Thus, contrary to SD, UD abandons treating a preposition as a mediator between a modified word and its object.) The `case` relation aims at providing a more uniform analysis of nominal elements, prepositions and case in morphologically rich languages: a nominal in an oblique case will receive the same dependency structure as a nominal introduced by an adposition.

When case markers are morphemes, they are not divided off the noun as a separate case dependent,
but the noun as a whole is analyzed as a [nmod]() of the verb.
To overtly mark case,
<a href="../pos/index.html">POS tags</a> and
<a href="../feat/index.html">features</a>
are included in the representation as shown below on a Russian example
(put your mouse pointer over the words to see additional morphosyntactic features).

This treatment provides parallelism between different constructions
across and within languages. A good result is that we now have greater
parallelism between prepositional phrases and subordinate clauses,
which are often introduced by a preposition in some languages:

~~~ sdparse
Sue left after the rehearsal
nsubj(left-2, Sue-1)
nmod(left-2, rehearsal-5)
det(rehearsal-5, the-4)
case(rehearsal-5, after-3)

~~~ sdparse
Sue left after we did
nsubj(left-2, Sue-1)
advcl(left-2, did-5)
mark(did-5, after-3)
nsubj(did-5, we-4)
~~~

We also obtain parallel constructions for


- the possessive alternation

~~~ sdparse

nmod(office-4, Chair-2)

~~~ sdparse

nmod(office-2, Chair-5)

6     enfants   enfant   NOUN   _   Gender=Masc|Number=Plur    1   nmod   _   children
~~~

Another advantage of this new analysis is that it provides a treatment
of prepositional phrases that are predicative complements of "be" that is consistent with the treatment of nominal predicative
complements:

~~~ sdparse
Sue is in shape
nsubj(shape-4, Sue-1)
cop(shape-4, is-2)
case(shape-4, in-3)
~~~

When prepositions are stacked (that is, there is a sequence of prepositions), there are two possible analyses. If the sequence is a frozen combination with a specific meaning, then the best analysis is as an `mwe`. An English example of this is *out of*:

~~~ sdparse
Out of all this , something good will come .
case(this-4, Out-1)
mwe(Out-1, of-2)
det(this-4, all-3)
nmod(come, this-4)
~~~

However, if various combinations of prepositions can be used to express different meaning combinations or nuances, then  each preposition is independently analyzed as a case dependent. Examples of this in English include *up beside* (which can alternate with *down beside* or *up near*) or *except during* which can alternate with *as during* or *except after*:

~~~ sdparse
The cafe up beside the lookout
det(cafe-2, The-1)
case(lookout-6, up-3)
case(lookout-6, beside-4)
det(lookout-6, the-5)
nmod(cafe-2, lookout-6)
~~~

For more on coordination, see the [conj]() relation.
A `cc` is the relation between the first conjunct and

We take the first conjunct as the head of the coordination.)

A coordinating conjunction may also appear at the beginning of a
sentence. This is also called a `cc`, and it depends on the root
predicate of the sentence.
(In fact there is a coordination that spans multiple sentences.
We cannot attach a word to the first conjunct because it is in another sentence.
Thus we attach it to the first conjunct available in the current sentence: its main predicate.)

	<div property="rdfs:comment">

A clausal complement of a verb or adjective is a dependent clause 
which is a core argument. That is, it functions like an object of the verb, or
adjective.

~~~ sdparse
He says that you like to swim
ccomp(says, like)
~~~

Such clausal complements may be finite or nonfinite. However, if the
subject of the clausal complement is controlled (that is, must be the same
as the higher subject or object, with no other possible interpretation)
the appropriate relation is [xcomp]().

~~~ sdparse
The boss said to start digging
ccomp(said, start)
~~~

~~~ sdparse
We started digging
xcomp(started, digging)
~~~

The key difference here is that, while it is possible to interpret the first
sentence to mean that the boss will not be doing any digging, in the second
sentence it is clear that the subject of __digging__ can only be __we__. This is
what distinguishes `ccomp` and `xcomp`.

Additionally, `ccomp` is used with copulas.

~~~ sdparse
The important thing is to keep calm.
ccomp(is, keep)
~~~

~~~ sdparse
The problem is that this has never been tried .
ccomp(is, tried)
~~~

(In these cases, the copula is treated as a head. This is a somewhat inconsistent and ugly feature of the current UD. An alternative solution was adopted for this case in the Turku TDT. It may be worth considering adopting it in a revision of UD.)

_Note:_ In earlier versions of SD/USD, complement
clauses with nouns like *fact* or *report* were also analyzed as `ccomp`. 
However, we now analyze them as [acl](). Hence, `ccomp` does not appear in nominals.
This makes sense, since nominals normally do not take core arguments.

`compound` is one of the three relations in UD for compounding.

It is used for 

- any kind of X<sup>0</sup> compounding: noun compounds (e.g., *phone book*), but also verb and
adjective compounds that are more common in other languages (such as
Persian or Japanese light verb constructions). It is also used for the "phrasal verb" construction of European languages (e.g., *throw up*), with the adposition as the `compound` dependent of the verb.

~~~ sdparse
Phone book
compound(book, Phone)
~~~


- for numbers

~~~ sdparse
I have four thousand sheep
compound(thousand, four)
~~~

~~~ sdparse
I lost $ 3.2 billion
compound(billion, 3.2)
~~~


- for particles of phrasal verbs:

~~~ sdparse
put up
compound(put, up)
~~~

The two other compounding relations are:

- [mwe]() for fixed grammaticized expressions with function words
- [name]() for proper nouns constituted of multiple nominal elements

	<h2><code property="rdfs:label" lang="">conj</code>: <div property="rdfs:label">conjunct</div></h2>
	<div property="rdfs:comment">

A conjunct is the relation between two elements connected by a
coordinating conjunction, such as _and, or,_ etc.  We treat
conjunctions asymmetrically: The head of the relation is the first
conjunct and all the other conjuncts depend on it via the `conj` relation.

~~~ sdparse
Bill is big and honest
conj(big, honest)
~~~

<div id="punct1" class="sd-parse">
We have apples , pears , oranges , and bananas .
dobj(have, apples)
conj(apples, pears)
conj(apples, oranges)
conj(apples, bananas)
cc(apples, and)
punct(apples, ,-4)
punct(apples, ,-6)
punct(apples, ,-8)
</div>

Coordinate clauses are treated the same way as coordination of other constituent types:

~~~ sdparse
He came home , took a shower and immediately went to bed .
conj(came, took)
conj(came, went)
punct(came, ,-4)
cc(came, and)
~~~

Coordination may be _asyndetic,_ which means that the coordinating conjunction is omitted.
Commas or other punctuation symbols will delimit the conjuncts in the typical case.
Asyndetic coordination may be more frequent in some languages, while in others, conjunction will appear between every two conjuncts _(John and Mary and Bill)._

~~~ sdparse
Veni , vidi , vici .
conj(Veni, vidi)
conj(Veni, vici)
punct(Veni, ,-2)
punct(Veni, ,-4)
~~~

### Shared Dependents and Effective Parents in Coordination

Note that the current basic annotation scheme cannot distinguish between a dependent of the first conjunct
and a shared dependent of the whole coordination:

~~~ sdparse
He met her at the station and kissed her .
conj(met, kissed)
nsubj(met, He)
~~~

vs.

~~~ sdparse
He met her at the station and she kissed him .
conj(met, kissed)
nsubj(met, He)
nsubj(kissed, she)
~~~

In contrast, the additional dependencies in the enhanced representation
can be used to encode the fact that in the first case, _he_ is also subject of _kissed:_

~~~ sdparse
He met her at the station and kissed her .
conj(met, kissed)
nsubj(met, He)
nsubj(kissed, He)
~~~

Furthermore, the enhanced representation can also capture the relation of each conjunct
to the parent of the coordination. Nevertheless, the effective parents can be found
algorithmically and showing them explicitly is for convenience only, while
the information about shared dependents is otherwise not available.

~~~ sdparse
I saw that he met her at the station and kissed her .
conj(met, kissed)
nsubj(met, he)
nsubj(kissed, he)
ccomp(saw, met)
ccomp(saw, kissed)
~~~

If a dependent is shared among conjuncts, the basic representation always links it to the
first conjunct (coordination head).
Relations to the other conjuncts are in the enhanced representation.
In the following example, enhanced dependencies are shown in red:

~~~ conllu
# visual-style 6 1 amod color:red
# visual-style 4 3 amod color:red
# visual-style 6 3 amod color:red
1 American   _ _ _ _ 4 amod 6:amod        _
2 and        _ _ _ _ 1 cc   _             _
3 British    _ _ _ _ 1 conj 4:amod|6:amod _
4 professors _ _ _ _ 0 root _             _
5 and        _ _ _ _ 4 cc   _             _
6 students   _ _ _ _ 4 conj 0:root        _
~~~

### Nested Coordination

Note further that the current annotation scheme has only a limited capability to capture nested coordination
such as _apples and pears or oranges and lemons._
Consider coordinations

* A, B, C
* (A, B), C
* A, (B, C)

The first two cases, i.e. (A, B, C) and ((A, B), C), lead to the same tree:

~~~ sdparse
A B C
conj(A, B)
conj(A, C)
~~~

Only the right-nesting case (A, (B, C)) can be distinguished because its tree is different:

~~~ sdparse
A B C
conj(B, C)
conj(A, B)
~~~

	<h2><code property="rdfs:label" lang="">cop</code>: <div property="rdfs:label">copula</div></h2>
	<div property="rdfs:comment">

A copula is the relation between the complement of a copular verb and
the copular verb *to be* (only).  (We normally take a copula as a dependent of its
complement.)

~~~ sdparse
Bill is honest
nsubj(honest, Bill)
cop(honest, is)
~~~

~~~ sdparse
Ivan is the best dancer
nsubj(dancer-5, Ivan-1)
cop(dancer-5, is-2)
det(dancer-5, the-3)
amod(dancer-5, best-4)
~~~

The copula *be* is not treated as the
head of a clause, but rather the dependent of a lexical predicate, as exemplified above.

Such an analysis is motivated by the fact that many languages
often or always lack an overt copula in such constructions, as in the
the following Russian example:

~~~ sdparse
Ivan luÄÅ¡ij tancor \n Ivan best dancer
nsubj(tancor, Ivan)
amod(tancor, luÄÅ¡ij)
~~~

In informal English, this may also arise.

~~~ sdparse
Email usually free if you have Wifi.
nsubj(free, Email)
~~~

This analysis is adopted also when the predicate is a prepositional phrase, in which case the nominal part of the 
prepositional phrase is the head of the clause.

~~~ sdparse
Sue is in shape
nsubj(shape, Sue)
cop(shape, is)
case(shape, in)
~~~

A parallel can also be drawn to so-called raising-to-object or small clause constructions in English.
Under the basic analysis proposed for SD, the predicate complement is
not linked to its subject argument, but in the enhanced representation
(see below), the linkage is then parallel to the treatment in a zero
copula language:

~~~ sdparse
I judge Ivan the best dancer
nsubj(judge-2, I-1)
dobj(judge-2, Ivan-3)
xcomp(judge-2, dancer-6)
det(dancer-6, the-4)
amod(dancer-6, best-5)
nsubj(dancer-6, Ivan-3)
~~~

If the copula is accompanied by other verbal auxiliaries for tense, aspect, etc., then they are also given a flat structure, and taken as dependents of the lexical predicate:

~~~ sdparse
Sue has been helpful
nsubj(helpful, Sue)
cop(helpful, been)
aux(helpful, has)
~~~

The motivation for this choice is that this structure is parallel to the flat structure which we give to auxiliary verbs accompanying verbs. In particular, in languages such as English, it is often very difficult to decide whether to regard a participle as a verb or an adjective.  Perhaps the following sentence is such a case:

~~~ sdparse
The presence of troops will be destabilizing .
nsubj(destabilizing, presence)
cop(destabilizing, be)
aux(destabilizing, will)
~~~

While a part of speech has to be decided in such cases, it would be unfortunate if the choice of part of speech also changed the dependency structure.

Finally, `ccomp` is used with copulas. Only in this case, the structure is different, and we take the form of *be* as a head:

~~~ sdparse
The important thing is to keep calm .
ccomp(is, keep)
nsubj(is, thing)
~~~

~~~ sdparse
The problem is that this has never been tried .
ccomp(is, tried)
nsubj(is, problem)
~~~

If we took the main verb as the head, it would have two subjects, which would be unworkable. Examples like the above *could* be analyzed reversed with the initial noun phrase as the predicate, but in addition to this seeming undesirable, it would fail to be a solution if there were a clause on both sides of *be*, such as in: *(For us) to not attempt to solve the problem is (for us) to acknowledge defeat*. (Note: This solution is awkward and refining it is a possible direction for the future; the original Finnish TDT was done differently and it may be worth considering their solution.)

The `dislocated` relation is used for fronted or postposed elements
that do not fulfill the usual core grammatical relations of a
sentence. These elements often appear to be in the periphery of the sentence, and may be separated off with a comma intonation.

It is used for fronted elements that introduce the topic of a sentence, as in the following Japanese and Greek examples. The dislocated element attaches to the head of the clause to which it belongs:

~~~ sdparse
è±¡ ã¯ é¼» ã é·ã \n zoo wa hana ga naga-i \n elephant TOPIC nose SUBJ long-PRES

dislocated(kserume, jani)
~~~

However, it would not be used for a topic-marked noun that is also the subject of the sentence; this would be an [nsubj]().

It is also used for postposed elements. The dislocated elements attach to the same governor as the dependent that they double for. Right dislocated elements are frequent in spoken languages. French and Greek examples follow.

~~~ sdparse

	<h2><code property="rdfs:label" lang="">dobj</code>: <div property="rdfs:label">direct object</div></h2>
	<div property="rdfs:comment">

The direct object of a verb is the second most core argument of a verb after the subject. 
Typically, it is the noun phrase that denotes the entity acted upon or which undergoes a change of state or motion (the proto-patient).

~~~ sdparse
She gave me a raise
dobj(gave, raise)
~~~

In languages distinguishing morphological [cases](u-feat/Case), the
direct object will often be marked by the accusative case. However,
verb valency may occasionally dictate a different form, such as the
dative case in the following German example:

~~~ sdparse
jemandem begegnen \n someone.Dat to-meet
dobj(begegnen, jemandem)
~~~

In general, if there is just one object, it should be labeled `dobj`,
regardless of the morphological case or semantic role that it bears. If there are two or more
objects, one of them should be `dobj` and the others should be
[iobj](). In such cases it is necessary to decide what is the most
directly affected object _(patient)._ The one exception is when there is a clausal complement. 
Then the clausal complement is regarded as a âclausal direct objectâ and an object nominal will be an iobj. 
There is more discussion of constructions with multiple objects
on the page for [iobj](). If possible, language-specific
documentation should be available to help identify direct objects.

	<h2><code property="rdfs:label" lang="">expl</code>: <div property="rdfs:label">expletive</div></h2>
	<div property="rdfs:comment">

This relation captures expletive or pleonastic nominals. These are nominals that appear in an argument position of a predicate but which do not themselves satisfy any of the semantic roles of the predicate. The main predicate of the clause (the verb or predicate adjective or noun) is the governor. In English, this is the case for some uses of *it* and *there*: the existential *there*, and *it* when used in extraposition constructions.  (Note that both *it* and *there* also have non-expletive uses.) 

~~~ sdparse

expl(is, There)
~~~

~~~ sdparse

expl(clear, It)
~~~

Some languages do not have expletives of the English sort, including most languages with free pro-drop (the ability to use zero anaphora rather than overt pronouns). In languages with expletives of this sort, they can be positioned where normally a core argument appears: the subject and direct object (and even indirect object) slots, as in the examples below. Note that in the analysis of these examples, we treat the postposed subject or clausal argument as a regular core argument, and mark the expletive with `expl`.

~~~ sdparse
There is a ghost in the room
expl(is, There)
nsubj(is, ghost)
nmod(is, room)
~~~

A second, related, use of the `expl` relation is for cases of true clitic doubling.  For languages in which clitics and lexical nominals are ususally in complementary distribution â languages, such as French, which obey "Kayne's generalization" â then whichever of a clitic or a lexical nominal occurs will get the appropriate role, such as `dobj` or `iobj`. In such languages, when doubling does occur, such as in spoken French, the right analysis is to regard the lexical nominal as [dislocated]() (see the examples there). However, other languages, such as Greek and Bulgarian, standardly allow doubling of a lexical nominal and a pronominal clitic, with the former still appearing in its regular role as an argument of the predicate. In these cases, if only one of the lexical nominal and the clitic appear in a clause, then whichever appears will be given the grammatical role of `dobj`, `iobj`, etc. â parallel to the treatment of lexical nominals and pronouns in other languages, modulo the clitic pronoun having a different position in the sentence.  However, if both occur, the lexical nominal will be given the grammatical role of `dobj`, `iobj`, etc., and the clitic will be treated as a pronominal copy, which does not receive its own semantic role, and hence will get the role `expl`. Modulo the different word order, this is fairly parallel to the treatment of _it_ and _there_ in English mentioned above, where another phrase satisfies the semantic role of the predicate. Examples from Greek and Bulgarian follow:

~~~ sdparse
Î¤Î·Ï ÏÎ¿Î½ Î­Î´ÏÏÎµ ÏÎ·Ï ÎÎ±Î¯ÏÎ·Ï ÏÎ¿Î½ Î±Î½Î±ÏÏÎ®ÏÎ± \n PRON.Fem.Gen PRON.Masc.Acc gave ART.Fem.Gen Keti.Gen ART.Masc.Acc lighter.Acc

case(rabotnika, na)
~~~

The expletive relation is also used for reflexive pronouns (see the feature [u-feat/Reflex]())
attached to inherently reflexive verbs, i.e. verbs that cannot occur without the reflexive
pronoun and thus the pronoun does not play the role of a normal object
(otherwise it would be possible to substitute it with an irreflexive pronoun or other nominal).
A Czech example:

~~~ sdparse
Martin se bojÃ­ zvÃ­Åat . \n Martin REFLEX fears animals .
expl(bojÃ­, se)
expl(fears, REFLEX)
~~~

Further general discussion of expletives can be found in Postal, P. M., and G. K. Pullum (1988) âExpletive Noun Phrases in Subcategorized Positions,â _Linguistic Inquiry_ 19(4): 635â670. The status of clitic doubling, and arguments for the lexical nominal being an argument with the clitic a kind of pronominal copy, appear inter alia in Boris Harizanov (2014) [Clitic doubling at the syntax-morphology interface: A-movement and morphological merger in Bulgarian](http://stanford.edu/~bharizan/pdfs/Harizanov_2014_NLLT.pdf). _Natural Language and Linguistic Theory_.

	<h2><code property="rdfs:label" lang="">iobj</code>: <div property="rdfs:label">indirect object</div></h2>
	<div property="rdfs:comment">

The indirect object of a verb is any nominal phrase that is a core
argument of the verb but is not its subject or [direct object](dobj).
The prototypical example is the recipient of ditransitive verbs of
exchange:

~~~ sdparse
She gave me a raise
iobj(gave, me)
~~~

However, many languages allow other semantic roles as additional objects. The most common case is allowing benefactives, but some languages allow other roles. Examples include instruments, such as in the Kinyarwanda example below, or comitatives. At the other extreme, some languages lack all indirect objects.

~~~ sdparse
UmukoÃ³bwa a-ra-andik-iish-a Ã­bÃ¡rÃºwa Ã­kÃ¡rÃ¡mu \n girl 1-PRS-write-APPL-ASP letter pen
dobj(a-ra-andik-iish-a, Ã­bÃ¡rÃºwa)
iobj(a-ra-andik-iish-a, Ã­kÃ¡rÃ¡mu)
~~~


In languages distinguishing morphological [cases](u-feat/Case), the indirect object will often be marked by the dative case. However, verb valency may occasionally dictate that the direct object is in dative, or that the indirect objects shall take various other forms.

In the following Czech example, the verb takes two arguments, both are nouns in the accusative case. One of them is direct object (patient), the other is indirect (addressee). It is parallel to how the English translation would be annotated (where there is no morphological case marking) and also to verbs of giving (consider a similar sentence, _he gave my daughter a class of maths_).

~~~ sdparse
On uÄÃ­ mou dceru matematiku . \n He teaches my daughter.Acc maths.Acc .
dobj(uÄÃ­, matematiku)
iobj(uÄÃ­, dceru)
dobj(teaches, maths.Acc)
iobj(teaches, daughter.Acc)
~~~

In general, if there is just one object, it should be labeled
[dobj](), regardless of the morphological case or semantic role. For example, in English, _teach_ can take either the subject matter or the recipient as the only object, and in both cases it would be analyzed ad the [dobj]():

~~~ sdparse
She teaches introductory logic
dobj(teaches, logic)
~~~

~~~ sdparse
She teaches the first-year students
dobj(teaches, students)
~~~

This is consistent with the analysis of Huddleston and Pullum (2002) âThe Cambridge Grammar of the English Languageâ,
chapter 4 section 4 (p. 251).  As they note, it is no different to the same semantic role being sometimes the subject
and sometimes the object in intransitive/transitive alternations. The one exception is when there is a clausal complement.
Then the clausal complement is regarded as a âclausal direct objectâ and an object nominal will be an iobj, parallel to
the simple ditransitive case:

~~~ sdparse
She told the students that they needed to study this evening
iobj(told, students)
ccomp(told, needed)
~~~

~~~ sdparse
She told the students the plan
iobj(told, students)
dobj(told, plan)
~~~

If there are two or
more objects, one of them should be [dobj]() and the others should be
`iobj`. In such cases it is necessary to decide what is the
most directly affected object _(patient)._ If possible,
language-specific documentation should help identify direct and
indirect objects.

	<div property="rdfs:comment">

The `list` relation is used for chains of comparable items. In lists with more than two items, all items of the list should modify the first one. Informal and web text often contains passages which are meant to be interpreted as lists but are parsed as single sentences. Email signatures often contain these structures, in the form of contact information: the different contact information items are labeled as `list`; the key-value pair relations are labeled as [appos]().

~~~ sdparse

appos(Email:-5, jones@abc.edf-6)
~~~

Another place where `list` has been used is for a sequence of attributes or descriptive terms used as the title line of a review (such as product or restaurant reviews, etc.:

~~~ sdparse
Long Lines , Silly Rules , Rude Staff , Ok Food
list(Lines, Rules)
list(Lines, Staff)
list(Lines, Food)
~~~

However, `list` should not be over-used. If a construction can be easily analyzed using the grammatical relations of standard sentences, such as when there is overt coordination, then it should be analyzed with these more standard relations, even if it is laid out as a list typographically.

A marker is the word introducing a finite clause subordinate to
another clause. For a [complement clause](ccomp), this is words like [en] _that_
or _whether._ For an [adverbial clause](advcl), the marker is typically a
[subordinating conjunction](../pos/SCONJ) like [en] _while_ or _although._ The mark is a dependent of the
subordinate clause head. In a relative clause, it is a normally uninflected word, which simply introduces a relative clause, such as [he] Å¡e.

The multi-word expression (modifier) relation is one of the three
relations ([compound](), `mwe`, [name]()) for compounding.
It is used for certain fixed grammaticized expressions that behave
like function words or short adverbials.

The scope of `mwe` annotation corresponds roughly to the *fixed
expressions* category of
[Sag et al.](http://lingo.stanford.edu/pubs/WP-2001-03.pdf), but
excludes any relations in scope of [name]() or [compound]().
Additionally, limited morphosyntactic variation may be allowed

`name` is one of the three relations for compounding in UD (together
with [compound]() and [mwe]()).
It is used for proper nouns constituted of multiple nominal
elements. For example, `name` would be used between the words of
_Hillary Rodham Clinton, New York,_ or _Carl XVI Gustaf_ but not to
replace the usual relations in a phrasal or clausal name like _The
king of Sweden_ or the novels _The Lord of the Rings_ and _Captured By
Aliens._
Words joined by `name` should all be part of a minimal noun phrase;
otherwise regular syntactic relations should be used.  This is
basically similar to the treatment of noun compounds with
[compound](), except that in many cases parts of the name may be
another nominal element such as an adjective _(United Airlines)._

In general, names are annotated in a flat, head-initial structure, in
which all words in the name modify the first one using the `name`
label.

~~~ sdparse
Carl XVI Gustaf
name(Carl-1, Gustaf-3)
name(Carl-1, XVI-2)
~~~

For organization names with clear syntactic modification structure, the dependencies should reflect the syntactic modification structure using regular syntactic relation, as in:.

~~~ sdparse
Natural Resources Conservation Service
amod(Resources-2, Natural-1)
compound(Conservation-3, Resources-2)
compound(Service-4, Conservation-3)
~~~

In addition, regular syntactic relations are used:
(i) for a modifying determiner or
(ii) to connect together the words of a description or name which involve embedded prepositional phrases, sentences, etc.

~~~ sdparse

In the case of proper entities named after people, e.g. _Leland Stanford Jr. University_, the `name` relation should only be used inside the person name, with the rest of the construction analyzed compositionally using normal syntactic relations:

The `nmod` relation is used for nominal modifiers. They depend either
on another noun (group ânoun dependentsâ) or on a predicate (group
ânon-core dependents of clausal predicatesâ).

`nmod` is a [noun](u-pos/NOUN) (or noun phrase) functioning as a
non-core (oblique) argument or adjunct.
This means that it functionally corresponds to an adverbial when it attaches to a verb, adjective or other adverb.
But when attaching to a noun, it corresponds to an attribute, or genitive complement (the terms are less standardized here).

The `nmod` relation can be further specified by the case. 
In conjunction with the [case]() relation, it provides a uniform
analysis for:

- the possessive alternation:

~~~ sdparse
the Chair 's office
det(Chair-2, the-1)
nmod(office-4, Chair-2)
case(Chair-2, 's-3)
~~~

~~~ sdparse
the office of the Chair
det(office-2, the-1)
nmod(office-2, Chair-5)
case(Chair-5, of-3)
det(Chair-5, the-4)
~~~


- variant forms with case, a preposition or a postposition, as in Finnish for example:

~~~ sdparse
etsiÃ¤ ilman johtolankaa \n to_search without clue.PARTITIVE
nmod(etsiÃ¤, johtolankaa)
case(johtolankaa, ilman)
~~~

~~~ sdparse
etsiÃ¤ taskulampun kanssa \n to_search torch.GENITIVE with
nmod(etsiÃ¤, taskulampun)
case(taskulampun, kanssa)
~~~

~~~ sdparse
etsiÃ¤ johtolangatta \n to_search clue.ABESSIVE
nmod(etsiÃ¤, johtolangatta)
~~~

- the dative alternation where the prepositional construction gets a similar analysis to the double object construction:

~~~ sdparse

dobj(give, toys)
iobj(give, children)
~~~

~~~ sdparse

	<h2><code property="rdfs:label" lang="">nsubj</code>: <div property="rdfs:label">nominal subject</div></h2>
	<div property="rdfs:comment">

A nominal subject (`nsubj`) is a nominal which is the syntactic subject and the proto-agent of a clause.
That is, it is in the position that passes typical grammatical test for subjecthood, and this argument is the more agentive,
the do-er, or the proto-agent of the clause. 
(See [csubj]() for when the subject is clausal. See [nsubjpass]() and [csubjpass]() for when the subject is not 
the proto-agent argument due to valence changing operations.) This nominal may be headed by a noun, 
or it may be a pronoun or relative pronoun, or in ellipsis contexts, other things such as an adjective.

The `nsubj` role is only applied to semantic arguments of a predicate.
When there is an empty argument in a grammatical subject position (sometimes called a pleonastic or expletive),
it is labeled as [expl](). If there is then a displaced subject
in the clause, as in the English existential _there_ construction, it will be labeled as `nsubj`.)
The governor of the `nsubj` relation might not always be a verb: when
the verb is a copular verb, the root of the clause is the complement
of the copular verb, which can be an adjective or noun, including a noun marked by a preposition,
as in the examples below.

	<h2><code property="rdfs:label" lang="">parataxis</code>: <div property="rdfs:label">parataxis</div></h2>
	<div property="rdfs:comment">

The parataxis relation (from Greek for "place side by side") is a
relation between a word (often the main predicate of a sentence) and other
elements, such as a sentential parenthetical or a clause after a â:â or
a â;â, placed side by side without any explicit
coordination, subordination, or argument relation with the head word. Parataxis is a discourse-like equivalent of coordination, and so usually obeys an iconic ordering. Hence it is normal for the first part of a sentence to be the head and the second part to be the parataxis dependent, regardless of the headedness properties of the language.  But things do get more complicated, such as cases of parentheticals, which appear medially.

~~~ sdparse

parataxis(Let, annoyed)

~~~ sdparse

~~~

## An inventory of constructions to which parataxis has been applied

### Side-by-side sentences ("run-on sentences")

The relation parataxis is used for a pair of what could have been standalone sentences, 
but which are being treated together as a single sentence. This may happen because sentence
segmentation of the sentence was done primarily following the presence of sentence-final punctuation,
and these clauses are joined by punctuation such as a colon or comma, or not delimited by punctuation
at all. In a spoken corpus, it may happen because what is labeled as a sentence is more
commonly an utterance turn. Even if the treebanker is doing the sentence division, it may
happen because there seems to be a clear discourse relation linking two clauses. 
Sometimes there are more than two sentences joined in this way. In this case we make all the later sentences
dependents of the first one, to maximize similarity to the analysis used for conjunction.

~~~ sdparse
Bearded dragons are sight hunters , they need to see the food to move .
parataxis(hunters, need)
~~~

This relation may happen with units that are smaller than sentences:

~~~ sdparse
Divided world the CIA
amod(world, Divided)
parataxis(world, CIA)
det(CIA, the)
~~~

### Treatment of reported speech

For this reported speech example:

~~~ sdparse
The guy , John said , left early in the morning
parataxis(left, said)
~~~

there are paraphrases that convey essentially the same meaning but
with a different syntactic structure. When the reported speech is embedded in a subordinate clause (with or 
without an overt complementizer _that_), the subordinate clause is a [ccomp]() of the speech verb. When the
reported speech follows the speech verb and is separated by a colon, the reported speech forms a main clause
that attaches to the preceding main clause with a [parataxis]() relation, hence with the speech verb as its head.
However, when the speech verb occurs as a medial or final parenthetical, the relation is reversed and the speech
verb is treated as a [parataxis]() of the reported speech. 
This analysis is not uncontroversial but follows many authorities, such as Huddleston and Pullum (2002),
_The Cambridge Grammar of the English Language_ (see chapter 11, section 9). 

~~~ sdparse
John said that the guy left early in the morning .
ccomp(said, left)
~~~

~~~ sdparse
John said the guy left early in the morning .
ccomp(said, left)
~~~

~~~ sdparse
John said : â The guy left early in the morning . â
parataxis(said, left)
~~~

~~~ sdparse
â The guy left early in the morning â , John said .
parataxis(left, said)
~~~

~~~ sdparse
The guy left early in the morning , John said .
parataxis(left, said)
~~~

~~~ sdparse
The guy , he said , left early in the morning .
parataxis(left, said)
~~~

An argument for this analysis is that in the cases analyzed as embedding, the entire clause
can be further embedded (_I was taken aback when John said the guy left early in the morning._),
while this is not possible with medial or final placement of the speech verb 
(_*I was taken aback when the guy left early this morning, John said._).

### News article bylines

We have used the parataxis relation to connect the parts of a news article byline. 
There does not seem to be a better relation to use.

~~~ sdparse
Washington ( CNN ) :
parataxis(Washington, CNN)
~~~

### Interjected clauses

Single word or phrase interjections are analyzed as [discourse](), but when a whole clause is interjected, we use the relation parataxis.

~~~ sdparse
Calafia has great fries ( they are to die for ! )
parataxis(has, are)
~~~

~~~ sdparse
Just to let you all know Matt has confirmed the booking for 3rd Dec is OK .
parataxis(confirmed, let)
~~~

In the second example, we treat the second half as the head of the dependency
because the first half feels like a whole clause interjection, not like the main clause of the utterance.

Tokens with the relation [u-dep/punct]() always attach to content words (except in cases of ellipsis) and can never have dependents.
Since `punct` is not a normal dependency relation, the usual criteria for determining the head word do not apply. 
Instead, we use the following principles:

1. A punctuation mark separating coordinated units is attached to the first conjunct.
2. A punctuation mark preceding or following a subordinated unit is attached to this unit.
3. Within the relevant unit, a punctuation mark is attached at the highest possible node that preserves projectivity.
4. Paired punctuation marks (quotes and brackets) should be attached to the same word unless that would create non-projectivity. This word is usually the head of the phrase enclosed in the paired punctuation.

	<h2><code property="rdfs:label" lang="">remnant</code>: <div property="rdfs:label">remnant in ellipsis</div></h2>
	<div property="rdfs:comment">

The `remnant` relation is used to provide a satisfactory treatment of ellipsis (in
the case of gapping and stripping, where a predicational or verbal
head gets elided). This is something that was lacking in earlier versions
of SD and provides a basis for being able to reconstruct dependencies
in the enhanced representation of UD. 
In particular, the goal was to achieve this *without* having to postulate empty nodes in the basic representation.

To develop motivation, consider first a sentence without ellipsis:

~~~ sdparse
Marie went to Paris and Miriam went to Prague
nsubj(went-2, Marie-1)
root(root-0, went-2)
nmod(went-2, Paris-4)
case(Paris-4, to-3)
cc(went-2, and-5)
nsubj(went-7, Miriam-6)
conj(went-2, went-7)
case(Prague-9, to-8)
nmod(went-7, Prague-9)
~~~

The question is then how to treat: *Marie went to Paris and Miriam to Prague*

~~~ sdparse
Marie went to Paris and Miriam to Prague
nsubj(went-2, Marie-1)
root(root-0, went-2)
nmod(went-2, Paris-4)
case(Paris-4, to-3)
cc(went-2, and-5)
case(Prague-8, to-7)
~~~

One option would be to pretend that there is an empty verb and to have the final elements be dependents of it: *Marie went to Paris and Miriam â to Prague*. This analysis has some appeal but also has some problems and at any rate stops the basic dependency graph from being simply a tree of dependencies over the words of a sentence. A second option is to simply promote the final elements and to have them as dependents of the main verb of the sentence (*went-2*) or of *root-0*. But then (in general) one loses the ability to successfully reconstruct the correct predicate-argument structure of the sentence from the basic dependency representation.

Therefore, UD adopts an analysis that notes that in ellipsis a `remnant` corresponds to a *correlate* in a preceding clause. The `remnant` relation connects each remnant to its correlate in the basic dependency representation. This is then a sufficient representation to reconstruct the predicate-argument structure in the enhanced representation. So, for this example, we have:

~~~ sdparse
Marie went to Paris and Miriam to Prague
nsubj(went-2, Marie-1)
root(root-0, went-2)
nmod(went-2, Paris-4)
case(Paris-4, to-3)
cc(went-2, and-5)
remnant(Marie-1, Miriam-6)
case(Prague-8, to-7)
remnant(Paris-4, Prague-8)
~~~

Even in the more complex example below, the `remnant`
relations enable us to correctly retrieve the subjects and objects in
the clauses with an elided verb.

~~~ sdparse
John won bronze , Mary silver , and Sandy gold
nsubj(won-2, John-1)
dobj(won-2, bronze-3)
remnant(John-1, Mary-5)
remnant(Mary-5, Sandy-9)
remnant(bronze-3, silver-6)
remnant(silver-6, gold-10)
~~~

Note in particular that (unlike for [conj]()), `remnant` uses a chaining analysis where each subsequent remnant depends on the immediately preceding remnant/correlate. The reason for this is that otherwise in a sentence with 2 or more chained ellipses the dependency structure would no longer track which remnants go together. It would become impossible to determine whether Mary won silver and Sandy gold, or Mary won gold and Sandy silver.

It is also possible that the incomplete part precedes the complete one in the sentence [de]:

~~~ sdparse
wÃ¤hrend 78 Prozent sich fÃ¼r Bush und vier Prozent fÃ¼r Clinton aussprachen \n while 78 percent REFL for Bush and four percent for Clinton spoke-out
nsubj(aussprachen, Prozent-9)
nsubj(spoke-out, percent-22)
nmod(aussprachen, Clinton-11)
nmod(spoke-out, Clinton-24)
remnant(Prozent-9, Prozent-3)
remnant(percent-22, percent-16)
remnant(Clinton-11, Bush-6)
remnant(Clinton-24, Bush-19)
~~~

The `remnant` relation is used when no predicational material is present. In contrast, in right-node-raising (RNR) and VP-ellipsis constructions in which some kind of predicational or verbal material is still present, the `remnant` relation is not used. In RNR, the verbs
are coordinated and the object is a [dobj]() of the first verb:

~~~ sdparse
John bought and ate an apple
nsubj(bought-2, John-1)
cc(bought-2, and-3)
conj(bought-2, ate-4)
det(apple-6, an-5)
dobj(bought-2, apple-6)
~~~

In VP-ellipsis, we keep the auxiliary as the head, as shown below:

~~~ sdparse
John will win gold and Mary will too
nsubj(win-3, John-1)
aux(win-3, will-2)
dobj(win-3, gold-4)
cc(win-3, and-5)
conj(win-3, will-7)
nsubj(will-7, Mary-6)
advmod(will-7, too-8)
~~~

The `root` grammatical relation points to the root of the sentence. A
fake node `ROOT` is used as the governor. The `ROOT` node is indexed
with 0, since the indexing of real words in the sentence starts at 1.

~~~ sdparse

<strong>Note: The following rule is not part of the official UD guidelines
version 1. But it has been agreed that it should become part of the future
versions of the standard, and the treebanks since release 1.2 should follow
it.</strong>

There should be just one node with the `root` dependency relation in every
tree. If the main predicate is not present (due to ellipsis) and there are
multiple orphaned dependents, the leftmost dependent should be promoted to
the head (root) position and the other orphans should be attached to it.

~~~ sdparse

<div about="#xcomp" property="rdfs:subClassOf" resource="#dep">
	<a id="al-u-dep/xcomp" class="al-dest" />
	<h2><code property="rdfs:label" lang="">xcomp</code>: <div property="rdfs:label">open clausal complement</div></h2>
	<div property="rdfs:comment">

An open clausal complement (`xcomp`) of a verb or an adjective is a
predicative or clausal complement without its own subject. The
reference of the subject is necessarily determined by an argument
external to the xcomp (normally by the object of the next higher
clause, if there is one, or else by the subject of the next higher
clause). This is often referred to as *obligatory control*. 
These clauses tend to be non-finite in many languages, 
but they can be finite as well. The name `xcomp` is
borrowed from Lexical-Functional Grammar.

~~~ sdparse
He says that you like to swim
xcomp(like, swim)
~~~

~~~ sdparse
Sue asked George to respond to her offer
xcomp(asked, respond)
~~~

~~~ sdparse
You look great
xcomp(look, great)
~~~

~~~ sdparse
I started to work there yesterday
xcomp(started, work)
~~~

~~~ sdparse
I consider him a fool
xcomp(consider, fool)
~~~

~~~ sdparse
I consider him honest
xcomp(consider, honest)
~~~

~~~ sdparse
We expect them to change their minds
xcomp(expect, change)
~~~

Note that the above condition âwithout its own subjectâ does not mean that a 
clause is an `xcomp` just because its subject is not _overt._ The subject must be necessarily inherited from a fixed position in the higher clause. That is, there should be no available interpretation where the subject of the lower clause may be distinct
from the specified role of the upper clause. In cases where the missing subject may or must be distinct from a fixed role in the higher clause, `ccomp` should be used instead, as below.  This includes cases of arbitrary subjects and anaphoric control.

~~~ sdparse
The boss said to start digging
ccomp(said, start)
~~~

Pro-drop languages have clauses where the subject is not present as a separate word,
yet it is inherently present (and often deducible from the form of the verb)
and it does not depend on arguments from a higher clause.
Thus in neither of the following two Czech examples is there any overt subject,
yet only the second example contains an `xcomp`.

~~~ sdparse
PÃ­Å¡u , protoÅ¾e jsem to slÃ­bil . \n I-write , because I-have it promised .
advcl(PÃ­Å¡u, slÃ­bil)
advcl(I-write, promised)
~~~

~~~ sdparse
SlÃ­bil jsem psÃ¡t . \n Promised I-have to-write .
xcomp(SlÃ­bil, psÃ¡t)
xcomp(Promised, to-write)
~~~

### Secondary Predicates

The `xcomp` relation is also used in constructions that are known as _secondary predicates_ or _predicatives_.
Examples:

* _She declared the cake beautiful._
* _She declared the cake a success._

We could paraphrase the sentence using a subordinate clause: _She declared that the cake was beautiful._
There are two predicates mixed in one clause: 1. she declared something, and 2. the cake was beautiful (according to her opinion).
The secondary predicate will be attached to the main predicate as an `xcomp`:

~~~ sdparse
She declared the cake beautiful .
nsubj(declared, She)
dobj(declared, cake)
xcomp(declared, beautiful)
~~~

In the enhanced representation, there is an additional subject link showing the secondary predication:

~~~ sdparse
She declared the cake beautiful .
nsubj(declared, She)
dobj(declared, cake)
xcomp(declared, beautiful)
nsubj(beautiful, cake)
~~~

A Czech example:

~~~ sdparse
jmenovat nÄkoho generÃ¡lem \n to-appoint someone as-a-general
dobj(jmenovat, nÄkoho)
xcomp(jmenovat, generÃ¡lem)
~~~

Remember that `xcomp` is used for core arguments of clausal predicates
so it will not be used for other instances of secondary predication.
For instance, in _She entered the room sad_ we also have a double predication
(she entered the room; she was sad).
But _sad_ is not a core argument of _enter:_ leaving it out will neither affect grammaticality
nor significantly alter the meaning of the verb.
On the other hand, leaving out _beautiful_ in _she declared the cake beautiful_
will either render the sentence ungrammatical or lead to a different interpretation of _declared._

The result is that in _She entered the room sad,_ _sad_ will depend on _She_
and the relation will be [acl]() instead of `xcomp`.
