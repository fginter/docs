Similarly to [Gender]() (and to the African noun classes), animacy is
usually a lexical feature of [nouns](u-pos/NOUN) and inflectional feature
of other parts of speech ([pronouns](u-pos/PRON),
[adjectives](u-pos/ADJ), [determiners](u-pos/DET), [numerals](u-pos/NUM),
[verbs](u-pos/VERB)) that mark agreement with
nouns. It is
independent of gender, therefore it is encoded separately in some
tagsets (e.g. all the Multext-East tagsets). On the other hand, in
Czech the (almost) only grammatical implications occur within the
masculine gender, which is why the PDT tagset does not have
animateness as separate feature and instead defines four genders:
masculine animate, masculine inanimate, feminine and neuter.  We
follow the two-feature approach used in Multext-East (many languages)
because it is safer.

Polish is special in that it also distinguishes grammatically human
vs. non-human animates. It can be demonstrated by inflection of the
example word _który_ "which" (boldface forms differ from the middle
row):

|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

### `Anim`: animate

Human beings, animals, fictional characters, names of professions
etc. are all animate. Even nouns that are normally inanimate can be
inflected as animate if they are personified. For instance, consider a
children's story about cars where cars live and talk as people; then
the cars may become and be inflected as animates.

### `Nhum`: animate but non-human

Attested in Polish. In languages where Nhum is used, `Anim` is
restricted to human beings (complement of `Nhum`).

### `Inan`: inanimate

Nouns that are not animate are inanimate. (If `Nhum` is used, nouns
that are neither `Anim` nor `Nhum` are `Inan`.)

Aspect is typically a feature of [verbs](u-pos/VERB).
It may also occur with other parts of speech
([nouns](u-pos/NOUN), [adjectives](u-pos/ADJ), [adverbs](u-pos/ADV)),
depending on whether borderline word forms such as gerunds and participles
are classified as verbs or as the other category.

Aspect is a feature that specifies duration of the action in time,
whether the action has been completed etc. In some languages
(e.g. English), some [tenses](Tense) are actually combinations of
tense and aspect. In other languages (e.g. Czech), aspect and tense
are separate, although not completely independent of each other.

In Czech and other Slavic languages, aspect is a lexical feature.
Pairs of imperfective and perfective verbs exist and are often
morphologically related but the space is highly irregular and the
verbs are considered to belong to separate lemmas.

Since we proceed bottom-up, the current standard covers only a few
aspect values found in corpora.  See Wikipedia
(&lt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_aspect&gt;) for a long list of
other possible aspects.

### `Imp`: imperfect aspect

The action took / takes / will take some time span and there is no
information whether and when it was / will be completed.

#### Examples

* [cs] _péci_ "to bake" (Imp); _<b>pekl</b> chleba_ "he baked / was
  baking a bread"

### `Perf`: perfect aspect

The action has been / will have been completed. Since there is
emphasis on one point on the time scale (the point of completion),
this aspect does not work well with the present tense. For example,
Czech morphology can create present forms of perfective verbs but
these actually have a future meaning.

#### Examples

* [cs] _upéci_ "to bake" (Perf); _<b>upekl</b> chleba_ "he baked / has
  baked a bread"

### `Pro`: prospective aspect

Used in Basque. A combination of tense and aspect that indicates the
action is in preparation to take place.

### `Prog`: progressive aspect

English progressive tenses (_I am eating, I have been doing &hellip;_)
have this aspect. They are constructed analytically (auxiliary +
present participle) but the _-ing_ participle is so bound to
progressive meaning that it seems a good idea to annotate it with this
feature (we have to distinguish it from the past participle somehow;
we may use both the "Tense" and the "Aspect" features).

In languages other than English, the progressive meaning may be
expressed by morphemes bound to the main verb, which makes this value
even more justified. Example is Turkish.

	<div property="rdfs:comment">
	
	
		<div style="visibility: hidden">["`Case` is usually an inflectional feature of [nouns](u-pos/NOUN) and,\ndepending on language, other parts of speech ([pronouns](u-pos/PRON),\n[adjectives](u-pos/ADJ), [determiners](u-pos/DET), [numerals](u-pos/NUM),\n[verbs](u-pos/VERB)) that mark agreement with nouns. In some tagsets\nit is also valency feature of [adpositions](u-pos/ADP) (saying that\nthe adposition requires its argument to be in that case).\n\nCase helps specify the role of the noun phrase in the sentence,\nespecially in free-word-order languages. For example, the nominative\nand accusative cases often distinguish subject and object of the verb,\nwhile in fixed-word-order languages these functions would be\ndistinguished merely by the positions of the nouns in the sentence.\n\nHere on the level of morphosyntactic features we are dealing with case\nexpressed morphologically, i.e. by bound morphemes (affixes). Note\nthat on a higher level case can be understood more broadly as _the\nrole,_ and it can be also expressed by adding an adposition to the\nnoun. What is expressed by affixes in one language can be expressed\nusing adpositions in another language. Cf. the [u-dep/case]()\ndependency label.\n\n#### Examples\n\n* [cs] nominative _matka_ \"mother\", genitive _matky_, dative _matce_,\n  accusative _matku_, vocative _matko_, locative _matce_,\n   instrumental _matkou_\n* [de] nominative _der Mann_ \"the man\", genitive _des Mannes_,\n  dative _dem Mann_, accusative _den Mann_\n* [en] nominative/direct case _he, she_,\n  accusative/oblique case _him, her._\n\nThe descriptions of the individual case values below include semantic\nhints about the prototypical meaning of the case. Bear in mind that\nquite often a case will be used for a meaning that is totally\nunrelated to the meaning mentioned here.  Valency of verbs,\nadpositions and other words will determine that the noun phrase must\nbe in a particular grammatical case to fill a particular valency slot\n(semantic role). It is much the same as trying to explain the meaning\nof prepositions: most people would agree that the central meaning of\nEnglish _in_ is location in space or time but there are phrases where\nthe meaning is less locational: _In God we trust._ _Say it in\nEnglish._\n\nNote that Indian corpora based on the so-called Paninian model use a\nrelated feature called _vibhakti_.  It is a merger of the Case feature\ndescribed here and of various postpositions. Values of the feature are\nlanguage-dependent because they are copies of the relevant morphemes\n(either bound morphemes or postpositions). Vibhakti can be mapped on\nthe Case values described here if we know 1. which source values are\nbound morphemes (postpositions are separate nodes for us) and 2. what\nis their meaning. For instance, the genitive case (`Gen`) in Bengali\nis marked using the suffix _-ra_ (-\u09B0), i.e. vib=era.  In Hindi, the\nsuffix has been split off the noun and it is now written as a separate\nword &ndash; the postposition _k\u0101/k\u012B/ke_ (\u0915\u093E/\u0915\u0940/\u0915\u0947).  Even if the\npostpositional phrase can be understood as a genitive noun phrase, the\nnoun is not in genitive. Instead, the postposition requires that it\ntakes one of three case forms that are marked directly on the noun:\nthe oblique case (`Acc`).\n\n### `Nom`: nominative / direct\n\nThe base form of the noun, typically used as citation form (lemma).\nIn many languages this is the word form used for subjects of clauses.\nIf the language has only two cases, which are called \"direct\" and\n\"oblique\", the direct case will be marked Nom.\n\n### `Acc`: accusative / oblique\n\nPerhaps the second most widely spread morphological case. In many\nlanguages this is the word form used for direct objects of verbs.  If\nthe language has only two cases, which are called \"direct\" and\n\"oblique\", the oblique case will be marked Acc.\n\n### `Abs`: absolutive\n\nSome languages (e.g. Basque) do not use nominative-accusative to\ndistinguish subjects and objects.  Instead, they use the contrast of\nabsolutive-ergative.\n\nThe absolutive case marks subject of intransitive verb and direct\nobject of transitive verb.\n\n### `Erg`: ergative\n\nSome languages (e.g. Basque) do not use nominative-accusative to\ndistinguish subjects and objects.  Instead, they use the contrast of\nabsolutive-ergative.\n\nThe ergative case marks subject of transitive verb.\n\n### `Dat`: dative\n\nIn many languages this is the word form used for indirect objects of verbs.\n\n#### Examples\n\n* [de] _Ich gebe <b>meinem Bruder</b> ein Geschenk._ \"I give my\n  brother a present.\" (_meinem Bruder_ \"my brother\" is dative and _ein\n  Geschenk_ \"a present\" is accusative.)\n\n### `Gen`: genitive\n\nPrototypical meaning of genitive is that the noun phrase somehow\nbelongs to its governor; it would often be translated by the English\npreposition _of_.  English has the \"saxon genitive\" formed by the\nsuffix _'s_; but we will normally not need the feature in English\nbecause the suffix gets separated from the noun during tokenization.\n\nNote that despite considerable semantic overlap, the genitive case is\nnot the same as the feature of possessivity ([Poss]()). Possessivity\nis a lexical feature, i.e. it applies to lemma and its whole\nparadigm. Genitive is a feature of just a subset of word forms of the\nlemma. Semantics of possessivity is much more clearly defined while\nthe genitive (as many other cases) may be required in situations that\nhave nothing to do with possessing. For example, [cs] _bez\nprezidentovy dcery_ \"without the president's daughter\" is a\nprepositional phrase containing the preposition _bez_ \"without\", the\npossessive adjective _prezidentovy_ \"president's\" and the noun _dcery_\n\"daughter\".  The possessive adjective is derived from the noun\n_prezident_ but it is really an adjective (with separate lemma and\nparadigm), not just a form of the noun. In addition, both the\nadjective and the noun are in their genitive forms (the nominative\nwould be _prezidentova dcera_).  There is nothing possessive about\nthis particular occurrence of the genitive. It is there because the\npreposition _bez_ always requires its argument to be in genitive.\n\n#### Examples\n\n* [cs] _Praha je hlavn\u00ED m\u011Bsto <b>\u010Cesk\u00E9 republiky</b>._ \"Prague is the\n  capital <b>of the Czech Republic</b>.\"\n\nNote that in Basque, Gen should be used for possessive genitive (as\nopposed to locative genitive): _<b>diktadorearen</b> erregimena_\n\"dictator's regime\"; _diktadore_ \"dictator\".\n\n### `Voc`: vocative\n\nThe vocative case is a special form of noun used to address\nsomeone. Thus it predominantly appears with animate nouns (see the\nfeature of [Animacy]()). Nevertheless this is not a grammatical\nrestriction and inanimate things can be addressed as well.\n\n#### Examples\n\n* [cs] _Co mysl\u00ED\u0161, <b>Filip</b><b>e</b>?_ \"What do you think,\n  <b>Filip</b>?\"\n\n### `Loc`: locative\n\nThe locative case often expresses location in space or time, which\ngave it its name. As elsewhere, non-locational meanings also exist and\nthey are not rare. Uralic languages have a complex set of fine-grained\nlocational and directional cases (see below) instead of the\nlocative. Even in languages that have locative, some location roles\nmay be expressed using other cases (e.g. because those cases are\nrequired by a preposition).\n\nIn Slavic languages this is the only case that is used exclusively in\ncombination with prepositions (but such a restriction may not hold in\nother languages that have locative).\n\n#### Examples\n\n* [cs] _V <b>\u010Dervenci</b> jsem byl ve <b>\u0160v\u00E9dsku</b>._ \"In <b>July</b>\n  I was in <b>Sweden</b>.\"\n* [cs] _Mluvili jsme tam o <b>morfologii</b>._ \"We talked there about\n  <b>morphology</b>.\" (Non-locational non-temporal example)\n\n### `Ins`: instrumental / instructive\n\nThe role from which the name of the instrumental case is derived is\nthat the noun is used as instrument to do something (as in [cs] _ps\u00E1t\n<b>perem</b>_ \"to write <b>using a pen</b>\").  Many other meanings are\npossible, e.g. in Czech the instrumental is required by the\npreposition _s_ \"with\" and thus it includes the meaning expressed in\nother languages by the comitative case.\n\nIn Czech the instrumental is also used for the agent-object in passive\nconstructions (cf. the English preposition _by_).\n\n#### Examples\n\n* [cs] _Tento z\u00E1kon byl schv\u00E1len <b>vl\u00E1dou</b>._ \"This bill has been\n  approved <b>by the government</b>.\" (Passive example)\n\nA semantically similar case called instructive is used rarely in\nFinnish to express \"with (the aid of)\". It can be applied to\ninfinitives that behave much like nouns in Finnish.  We propose one\nlabel for both instrumental and instructive (instrumental is not\ndefined in Finnish).\n\n#### Examples\n\n* [fi] _l\u00E4hte\u00E4_ \"to leave\"; _2003 <b>l\u00E4htien</b>_ \"since 2003\" (second\n  infinitive in the instructive case)\n* [fi] _yll\u00E4tt\u00E4\u00E4_ \"to surprise\"; _sekaantui <b>yll\u00E4tt\u00E4en</b>\n  valtataisteluun_ lit. _was-involved-in by-surprise.Ins\n  power-struggle.Ill._\n\n### `Par`: partitive\n\nIn Finnish the partitive case expresses indefinite identity and\nunfinished actions without result.\n\n#### Examples\n\n* [fi] _kolme <b>taloa</b>_ \"three <b>houses</b>\"; (the _-a_ suffix of\n  _talo_)\n* [fi] _rakastan t\u00E4t\u00E4 <b>taloa</b>_ \"I love this <b>house</b>\"\n* [fi] _saanko lainata <b>kirjaa</b>?_ \"can I borrow the <b>book</b>?\"\n  (the _-a_ suffix of _kirja_)\n* [fi]_lasissa on <b>maitoa</b>_ \"there is (some) <b>milk</b> in the\n  glass\"\n\nExamples comparing partitive with accusative: _ammuin karhun_ \"I shot\na bear.Acc\" (and I know that it is dead); _ammuin karhua_ \"I shot at a\nbear.Par\" (but I may have missed).\n\nUsing accusative instead of partitive may also substitute the missing\nfuture tense: _luen kirjan_ \"I will read the book.Acc\"; _luen kirjaa_\n\"I am reading the book.Par\".\n\n### `Dis`: distributive\n\nThe distributive case conveys that something happened to every member\nof a set, one in a time. Or it may express frequency.\n\n#### Examples\n\n* [hu] _<b>fejenk\u00E9nt</b>_ \"per capita\"\n* [hu] _<b>esetenk\u00E9nt</b>_ \"in some cases\"\n* [hu] _<b>hetenk\u00E9nt</b>_ \"once per week, weekly\"\n* [hu] _<b>t\u00EDzpercenk\u00E9nt</b>_ \"every ten minutes\"\n\n### `Ess`: essive / prolative\n\nThe essive case expresses a temporary state, often it corresponds to\nEnglish \"as a &hellip;\" A similar case in Basque is called prolative\nand it should be tagged `Ess` too.\n\n#### Examples\n\n* [fi] _lapsi_ \"child\"; _<b>lapsena</b>_ \"as a child / when he/she was child\"\n* [et] _laps_ \"child\"; _<b>lapsena</b>_ \"as a child\"\n* [eu] _erreformista_ \"reformer\"; _<b>erreformistatzat</b>_ \"as a reformer\"\n\n### `Tra`: translative / factive\n\nThe translative case expresses a change of state (\"it becomes X\", \"it\nchanges to X\").  Also used for the phrase \"in language X\".

Other meanings are possible as well, e.g. \"about\nsomething\".\n\n#### Examples\n\n* [hu] _asztal_ \"table\"; _az <b>asztal</b><b>r\u00F3l</b>_ \"off the table\"\n* [hu]_<b>Budapestr\u0151l</b> j\u00F6v\u00F6k_ \"I am coming from Budapest\"\n\n### `Lat`: lative / directional allative\n\nThe lative case denotes movement towards/to/into/onto\nsomething. Similar case in Basque is called directional allative\n(Spanish _adlativo direccional_).  However, lative is typically\nthought of as a union of allative, illative and sublative, while in\nBasque it is derived from allative, which also exists independently.\n\n#### Examples\n\n* [eu] _behe_ \"low\"; _<b>beherantz</b>_ \"down\"\n\n### `Tem`: temporal\n\nThe temporal case is used to indicate time.\n\n#### Examples\n\n* [hu] _<b>h\u00E9tkor</b>_ \"at seven (o'clock)\"; _<b>\u00E9jf\u00E9lkor</b>_ \"at midnight\";\n  _<b>kar\u00E1csonykor</b>_ \"at Christmas\"\n\n### `Ter`: terminative / terminal allative\n\nThe terminative case specifies where something ends in space or\ntime. Similar case in Basque is called terminal allative (Spanish\n_adlativo terminal_).\n\n#### Examples\n\n* [et] _<b>j&otilde;eni</b>_ \"down to the river\"; _kella <b>kuueni</b>_\n  \"till six o'clock\"\n* [hu] _a <b>h\u00E1zig</b>_ \"up to the house\"; _hat <b>\u00F3r\u00E1ig</b>_ \"till\n  six o'clock\"\n* [eu] _erdi_ \"half\"; _<b>erdiraino</b>_ \"up to the half\"\n\n### `Cau`: causative / motivative\n\nNoun in this case is the cause of something. In Hungarian it also\nseems to be used frequently with currency (\"to buy something _for_ the\nmoney\") and it also can mean the goal of something.\n\n#### Examples\n\n* [hu] _Egy vil\u00E1gc\u00E9g benzink\u00FAtj\u00E1n\u00E1l 7183 <b>forint\u00E9rt</b> tankoltam._\n  lit. _a world-wide.company petrol.station.Ade 7183 forint.Cau\n  refueled_ \"I refueled my car at the petrol station of a world-wide\n  company for 7183 forints.\"\n* [hu] _Elmentem a boltba <b>tej\u00E9rt</b>._ lit. _went the shop.Ill\n  milk.Cau_ \"I went to the shop to buy milk.\"\n* [eu] _jokaera_ \"behavior\"; _<b>jokaeragatik</b>_ \"because of\n  behavior\"\n\n### `Ben`: benefactive / destinative\n\nThe benefactive case corresponds to the English preposition _for_.\n\n#### Examples\n\n* [eu] _mutil_ \"boy\"; _<b>mutilarentzat</b>_ \"for boys\"\n"]</div>
	


`Case` is usually an inflectional feature of [nouns](u-pos/NOUN) and,
depending on language, other parts of speech ([pronouns](u-pos/PRON),
[adjectives](u-pos/ADJ), [determiners](u-pos/DET), [numerals](u-pos/NUM),
[verbs](u-pos/VERB)) that mark agreement with nouns. In some tagsets
it is also valency feature of [adpositions](u-pos/ADP) (saying that
the adposition requires its argument to be in that case).

Case helps specify the role of the noun phrase in the sentence,
especially in free-word-order languages. For example, the nominative
and accusative cases often distinguish subject and object of the verb,
while in fixed-word-order languages these functions would be
distinguished merely by the positions of the nouns in the sentence.

Here on the level of morphosyntactic features we are dealing with case
expressed morphologically, i.e. by bound morphemes (affixes). Note
that on a higher level case can be understood more broadly as _the
role,_ and it can be also expressed by adding an adposition to the
noun. What is expressed by affixes in one language can be expressed
using adpositions in another language. Cf. the [u-dep/case]()
dependency label.

#### Examples

* [cs] nominative _matka_ "mother", genitive _matky_, dative _matce_,
  accusative _matku_, vocative _matko_, locative _matce_,
   instrumental _matkou_
* [de] nominative _der Mann_ "the man", genitive _des Mannes_,
  dative _dem Mann_, accusative _den Mann_
* [en] nominative/direct case _he, she_,
  accusative/oblique case _him, her._

The descriptions of the individual case values below include semantic
hints about the prototypical meaning of the case. Bear in mind that
quite often a case will be used for a meaning that is totally
unrelated to the meaning mentioned here.  Valency of verbs,
adpositions and other words will determine that the noun phrase must
be in a particular grammatical case to fill a particular valency slot
(semantic role). It is much the same as trying to explain the meaning
of prepositions: most people would agree that the central meaning of
English _in_ is location in space or time but there are phrases where
the meaning is less locational: _In God we trust._ _Say it in
English._

Note that Indian corpora based on the so-called Paninian model use a
related feature called _vibhakti_.  It is a merger of the Case feature
described here and of various postpositions. Values of the feature are
language-dependent because they are copies of the relevant morphemes
(either bound morphemes or postpositions). Vibhakti can be mapped on
the Case values described here if we know 1. which source values are
bound morphemes (postpositions are separate nodes for us) and 2. what
is their meaning. For instance, the genitive case (`Gen`) in Bengali
is marked using the suffix _-ra_ (-র), i.e. vib=era.  In Hindi, the
suffix has been split off the noun and it is now written as a separate
word &ndash; the postposition _kā/kī/ke_ (का/की/के).  Even if the
postpositional phrase can be understood as a genitive noun phrase, the
noun is not in genitive. Instead, the postposition requires that it
takes one of three case forms that are marked directly on the noun:
the oblique case (`Acc`).

### `Nom`: nominative / direct

The base form of the noun, typically used as citation form (lemma).
In many languages this is the word form used for subjects of clauses.
If the language has only two cases, which are called "direct" and
"oblique", the direct case will be marked Nom.

### `Acc`: accusative / oblique

Perhaps the second most widely spread morphological case. In many
languages this is the word form used for direct objects of verbs.  If
the language has only two cases, which are called "direct" and
"oblique", the oblique case will be marked Acc.

### `Abs`: absolutive

Some languages (e.g. Basque) do not use nominative-accusative to
distinguish subjects and objects.  Instead, they use the contrast of
absolutive-ergative.

The absolutive case marks subject of intransitive verb and direct
object of transitive verb.

### `Erg`: ergative

Some languages (e.g. Basque) do not use nominative-accusative to
distinguish subjects and objects.  Instead, they use the contrast of
absolutive-ergative.

The ergative case marks subject of transitive verb.

### `Dat`: dative

In many languages this is the word form used for indirect objects of verbs.

#### Examples

* [de] _Ich gebe <b>meinem Bruder</b> ein Geschenk._ "I give my
  brother a present." (_meinem Bruder_ "my brother" is dative and _ein
  Geschenk_ "a present" is accusative.)

### `Gen`: genitive

Prototypical meaning of genitive is that the noun phrase somehow
belongs to its governor; it would often be translated by the English
preposition _of_.  English has the "saxon genitive" formed by the
suffix _'s_; but we will normally not need the feature in English
because the suffix gets separated from the noun during tokenization.

Note that despite considerable semantic overlap, the genitive case is
not the same as the feature of possessivity ([Poss]()). Possessivity
is a lexical feature, i.e. it applies to lemma and its whole
paradigm. Genitive is a feature of just a subset of word forms of the
lemma. Semantics of possessivity is much more clearly defined while
the genitive (as many other cases) may be required in situations that
have nothing to do with possessing. For example, [cs] _bez
prezidentovy dcery_ "without the president's daughter" is a
prepositional phrase containing the preposition _bez_ "without", the
possessive adjective _prezidentovy_ "president's" and the noun _dcery_
"daughter".  The possessive adjective is derived from the noun
_prezident_ but it is really an adjective (with separate lemma and
paradigm), not just a form of the noun. In addition, both the
adjective and the noun are in their genitive forms (the nominative
would be _prezidentova dcera_).  There is nothing possessive about
this particular occurrence of the genitive. It is there because the
preposition _bez_ always requires its argument to be in genitive.

#### Examples

* [cs] _Praha je hlavní město <b>České republiky</b>._ "Prague is the
  capital <b>of the Czech Republic</b>."

Note that in Basque, Gen should be used for possessive genitive (as
opposed to locative genitive): _<b>diktadorearen</b> erregimena_
"dictator's regime"; _diktadore_ "dictator".

### `Voc`: vocative

The vocative case is a special form of noun used to address
someone. Thus it predominantly appears with animate nouns (see the
feature of [Animacy]()). Nevertheless this is not a grammatical
restriction and inanimate things can be addressed as well.

#### Examples

* [cs] _Co myslíš, <b>Filip</b><b>e</b>?_ "What do you think,
  <b>Filip</b>?"

### `Loc`: locative

The locative case often expresses location in space or time, which
gave it its name. As elsewhere, non-locational meanings also exist and
they are not rare. Uralic languages have a complex set of fine-grained
locational and directional cases (see below) instead of the
locative. Even in languages that have locative, some location roles
may be expressed using other cases (e.g. because those cases are
required by a preposition).

In Slavic languages this is the only case that is used exclusively in
combination with prepositions (but such a restriction may not hold in
other languages that have locative).

#### Examples

* [cs] _V <b>červenci</b> jsem byl ve <b>Švédsku</b>._ "In <b>July</b>
  I was in <b>Sweden</b>."
* [cs] _Mluvili jsme tam o <b>morfologii</b>._ "We talked there about
  <b>morphology</b>." (Non-locational non-temporal example)

### `Ins`: instrumental / instructive

The role from which the name of the instrumental case is derived is
that the noun is used as instrument to do something (as in [cs] _psát
<b>perem</b>_ "to write <b>using a pen</b>").  Many other meanings are
possible, e.g. in Czech the instrumental is required by the
preposition _s_ "with" and thus it includes the meaning expressed in
other languages by the comitative case.

In Czech the instrumental is also used for the agent-object in passive
constructions (cf. the English preposition _by_).

#### Examples

* [cs] _Tento zákon byl schválen <b>vládou</b>._ "This bill has been
  approved <b>by the government</b>." (Passive example)

A semantically similar case called instructive is used rarely in
Finnish to express "with (the aid of)". It can be applied to
infinitives that behave much like nouns in Finnish.  We propose one
label for both instrumental and instructive (instrumental is not
defined in Finnish).

#### Examples

* [fi] _lähteä_ "to leave"; _2003 <b>lähtien</b>_ "since 2003" (second
  infinitive in the instructive case)
* [fi] _yllättää_ "to surprise"; _sekaantui <b>yllättäen</b>
  valtataisteluun_ lit. _was-involved-in by-surprise.Ins
  power-struggle.Ill._

### `Par`: partitive

In Finnish the partitive case expresses indefinite identity and
unfinished actions without result.

#### Examples

* [fi] _kolme <b>taloa</b>_ "three <b>houses</b>"; (the _-a_ suffix of
  _talo_)
* [fi] _rakastan tätä <b>taloa</b>_ "I love this <b>house</b>"
* [fi] _saanko lainata <b>kirjaa</b>?_ "can I borrow the <b>book</b>?"
  (the _-a_ suffix of _kirja_)
* [fi]_lasissa on <b>maitoa</b>_ "there is (some) <b>milk</b> in the
  glass"

Examples comparing partitive with accusative: _ammuin karhun_ "I shot
a bear.Acc" (and I know that it is dead); _ammuin karhua_ "I shot at a
bear.Par" (but I may have missed).

Using accusative instead of partitive may also substitute the missing
future tense: _luen kirjan_ "I will read the book.Acc"; _luen kirjaa_
"I am reading the book.Par".

### `Dis`: distributive

The distributive case conveys that something happened to every member
of a set, one in a time. Or it may express frequency.

#### Examples

* [hu] _<b>fejenként</b>_ "per capita"
* [hu] _<b>esetenként</b>_ "in some cases"
* [hu] _<b>hetenként</b>_ "once per week, weekly"
* [hu] _<b>tízpercenként</b>_ "every ten minutes"

### `Ess`: essive / prolative

The essive case expresses a temporary state, often it corresponds to
English "as a &hellip;" A similar case in Basque is called prolative
and it should be tagged `Ess` too.

#### Examples

* [fi] _lapsi_ "child"; _<b>lapsena</b>_ "as a child / when he/she was child"
* [et] _laps_ "child"; _<b>lapsena</b>_ "as a child"
* [eu] _erreformista_ "reformer"; _<b>erreformistatzat</b>_ "as a reformer"

### `Tra`: translative / factive

The translative case expresses a change of state ("it becomes X", "it
changes to X").  Also used for the phrase "in language X". In the
Szeged Treebank, this case is called factive.

#### Examples

* [fi] _pitkä_ "long"; _kasvoi <b>pitkäksi</b>_ "grew long"
* [fi] _englanti_ "English language"; _<b>englanniksi</b>_ "in/into English"
* [fi] _kello kuusi_ "six o'clock"; _kello <b>kuudeksi</b>_ "by six o'clock"
* [et] _kell kuus_ "six o'clock"; _kella <b>kuueks</b>_ "by six o'clock"
* [hu] _Oroszlány halott <b>várossá</b> válhat._ lit. _Oroszlány dead city.Tra
  could-become._ "Oroszlány could become a dead city."

### `Com`: comitative / associative

The comitative (also called associative) case corresponds to English
"together with &hellip;"

#### Examples

* [et] _koer_ "dog"; _<b>koeraga</b>_ "with dog"

### `Abe`: abessive

The abessive case corresponds to the English preposition _without_.

#### Examples

* [fi] _raha_ "money"; _<b>rahatta</b>_ "without money"

### `Ine`: inessive

The inessive case expresses location inside of something.

#### Examples

* [hu] _ház_ "house"; _<b>házban</b>_ "in the house"
* [fi] _talo_ "house"; _<b>talossa</b>_ "in the house"
* [et] _maja_ "house"; _<b>majas</b>_ "in the house"

### `Ill`: illative

The illative case expresses direction into something.

#### Examples

* [hu]_ház_ "house"; _<b>házb</b><b>a</b>_ "into the house"
* [fi] _talo_ "house"; _<b>talo</b><b>on</b>_ "into the house"
* [et] _maja_ "house"; _<b>majas</b><b>se / majja</b>_ "into the house"

### `Ela`: elative

The elative case expresses direction out of something.

#### Examples

* [hu]_ház_ "house"; _<b>házból</b>_ "from the house"
* [fi] _talo_ "house"; _<b>talos</b><b>t</b><b>a</b>_ "from the house"
* [et] _maja_ "house"; _<b>majas</b><b>t</b>_ "from the house"

### `Add`: additive

Distinguished by some scholars in Estonian, not recognized by
traditional grammar, exists in the Multext-East Estonian tagset and in
the Eesti keele puudepank.  Reportedly same or similar meaning as
illative. Forms of this case exist only in singular and not for all
nouns.

### `Ade`: adessive

The adessive case expresses location at or on something.  The
corresponding directional cases are allative (towards something) and
ablative (from something).

#### Examples

* [hu] _pénztár_ "cash desk"; _<b>pénztárnál</b>_ "at the cash desk"
* [fi] _pöytä_ "table"; _<b>pöydällä</b>_ "on the table"
* [et] _laud_ "table";_<b>laual</b>_ "on the table"

Note that adessive is used to express location on the surface of
something in Finnish and Estonian, but does not carry this meaning in
Hungarian.

### `All`: allative

The allative case expresses direction to something (destination is
adessive, i.e. at or on that something).

#### Examples

* [hu] _pénztár_ "cash desk"; _<b>pénztár</b><b>hoz</b>_ "to the cash desk"
* [fi] _pöytä_ "table"; _<b>pöydäll</b><b>e</b>_ "onto the table"

### `Abl`: ablative

Prototypical meaning: direction from some point.

#### Examples

* [hu] _a <b>barátomtól</b> jövök_ "I'm coming <b>from my friend</b>"
* [fi] _pöydältä_ "from the table"; _katolta_ "from the roof";
  _rannalta_ "from the beach"

### `Sup`: superessive

Used, chiefly [in
Hungarian](http://www.hungarianreference.com/Nouns/-n-superessive.aspx),
to indicate location on top of something or on the surface of
something.

#### Examples

* [hu] _asztal_ "table"; _<b>asztalon</b>_ "on the table"
* [hu] _könyvek_ "books"; _<b>könyveken</b>_ "on books"

### `Sub`: sublative

The sublative case is used in Finno-Ugric languages to express the
destination of movement, originally to the surface of something
(e.g. "to climb a tree"), and, by extension, in other figurative
meanings as well (e.g. "to university").

#### Examples

* [hu] _Belgrádtól 150 <b>kilométerre délnyugatra</b>_ lit.
  _Belgrade.Abl 150 kilometer.Sub southwest.Sub_ "150 kilometers
  southwest of Belgrade"
* [hu] _hajó_ "ship"; _<b>hajóra</b>_ "onto the ship"
* [hu] _<b>bokorra</b>_ "on the shrub"

### `Del`: delative

Used, chiefly [in
Hungarian](http://www.hungarianreference.com/Nouns/ról-rol-delative.aspx),
to express the movement from the surface of something (like "moved off
the table"). Other meanings are possible as well, e.g. "about
something".

#### Examples

* [hu] _asztal_ "table"; _az <b>asztal</b><b>ról</b>_ "off the table"
* [hu]_<b>Budapestről</b> jövök_ "I am coming from Budapest"

### `Lat`: lative / directional allative

The lative case denotes movement towards/to/into/onto
something. Similar case in Basque is called directional allative
(Spanish _adlativo direccional_).  However, lative is typically
thought of as a union of allative, illative and sublative, while in
Basque it is derived from allative, which also exists independently.

#### Examples

* [eu] _behe_ "low"; _<b>beherantz</b>_ "down"

### `Tem`: temporal

The temporal case is used to indicate time.

#### Examples

* [hu] _<b>hétkor</b>_ "at seven (o'clock)"; _<b>éjfélkor</b>_ "at midnight";
  _<b>karácsonykor</b>_ "at Christmas"

### `Ter`: terminative / terminal allative

The terminative case specifies where something ends in space or
time. Similar case in Basque is called terminal allative (Spanish
_adlativo terminal_).

#### Examples

* [et] _<b>j&otilde;eni</b>_ "down to the river"; _kella <b>kuueni</b>_
  "till six o'clock"
* [hu] _a <b>házig</b>_ "up to the house"; _hat <b>óráig</b>_ "till
  six o'clock"
* [eu] _erdi_ "half"; _<b>erdiraino</b>_ "up to the half"

### `Cau`: causative / motivative

Noun in this case is the cause of something. In Hungarian it also
seems to be used frequently with currency ("to buy something _for_ the
money") and it also can mean the goal of something.

#### Examples

* [hu] _Egy világcég benzinkútjánál 7183 <b>forintért</b> tankoltam._
  lit. _a world-wide.company petrol.station.Ade 7183 forint.Cau
  refueled_ "I refueled my car at the petrol station of a world-wide
  company for 7183 forints."
* [hu] _Elmentem a boltba <b>tejért</b>._ lit. _went the shop.Ill
  milk.Cau_ "I went to the shop to buy milk."
* [eu] _jokaera_ "behavior"; _<b>jokaeragatik</b>_ "because of
  behavior"

### `Ben`: benefactive / destinative

The benefactive case corresponds to the English preposition _for_.

#### Examples

* [eu] _mutil_ "boy"; _<b>mutilarentzat</b>_ "for boys"

Definiteness is typically a feature of nouns, adjectives and
articles. Its value distinguishes whether we are talking about
something known and concrete, or something general or unknown. It can
be marked on definite and indefinite [articles](u-pos/DET), or
directly on [nouns](u-pos/NOUN), [adjectives](u-pos/ADJ) etc.  In
Arabic, definiteness is also called the "state".

### `Ind`: indefinite

#### Examples

* [en] _<b>a</b> dog_

### `Def`: definite

#### Examples

* [en] _<b>the</b> dog_

### `Red`: reduced

Used in [construct
state](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Status_constructus) in Arabic. If
two nouns are in genitive relation, the first one (the "nomen regens")
has "reduced definiteness," the second is the genitive and can be
either definite or indefinite.  Reduced form has neither the definite
morpheme (article), nor the indefinite morpheme (nunation).

#### Examples

* [ar] indefinite state: حلوَةٌ_ḥulwatun_ "a sweet"; definite state:
  الحلوَةُ _al-ḥulwatu_ "the sweet"; <b>حلوَةُ </b>_<b>ḥulwatu</b>_
  "sweet of".

### `Com`: complex

Used in <a href="http://books.google.cz/books?id=rs3hzfgj3hoC&amp;pg=PA131&amp;lpg=PA131&amp;dq=arabic+improper+annexation&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=d6gGCpprOX&amp;sig=3G6YkRZsIy_EL0OCEh7_V7qqnlE&amp;hl=cs&amp;ei=ZasDTuLhGc_vsgaLlcyeDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CB4Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=arabic%20improper%20annexation&amp;f=false">improper
annexation</a> in Arabic. The genitive construction described above
normally consists of two nouns (first reduced, second genitive). That
is called proper annexation or iḍāfa. If the first member is an
adjective or adjectivally used participle and the second member is a
definite noun, the construction is called improper annexation or false
iḍāfa.  The result is a compound adjective that is usually used as an
attributive adjunct and thus must agree in definiteness with the noun
it modifies. Its first part (the adjective or participle) may get
again the definite article. Although it may look the same as the form
for the definite state, it is assigned a special value of _complex_
state to reflect the different origin. See also <a href="http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/padt/PADT_1.0/docs/papers/2004-nemlar-padt.pdf">Hajič

Degree of comparison is typically an inflectional feature of some
[adjectives](u-pos/ADJ) and [adverbs](u-pos/ADV).

### `Pos`: positive, first degree

This is the base form that merely states a quality of something,
without comparing it to qualities of others. Note that although this
degree is traditionally called "positive", negative properties can be
compared, too.

#### Examples

* [en] _<b>young</b> man_
* [cs] _<b>mladý</b> muž_

### `Cmp`: comparative, second degree

The quality of one object is compared to the same quality of another
object.

#### Examples

* [en] _the man is <b>younger</b> than me_
* [cs] _ten muž je <b>mladší</b> než já_

### `Sup`: superlative, third degree

The quality of one object is compared to the same quality of all other
objects within a set.

#### Examples

* [en] _this is the <b>youngest</b> man in our team_
* [cs] _toto je <b>nejmladší</b> muž v našem týmu_

### `Abs`: absolute superlative

Some languages can express morphologically that the studied quality of
the given object is so strong that there is hardly any other object
exceeding it. The quality is not actually compared to any particular
set of objects.

#### Examples

* [es] _guapo_ "handsome"; _<b>guapísimo</b>_ "<b>indescribably
  handsome</b>"

`Gender` is usually a lexical feature of [nouns](u-pos/NOUN) and inflectional feature
of other parts of speech ([pronouns](u-pos/PRON),
[adjectives](u-pos/ADJ), [determiners](u-pos/DET), [numerals](u-pos/NUM),
[verbs](u-pos/VERB)) that mark agreement with
nouns. In English gender affects only the choice of the personal
pronoun _(he / she / it)_ and the feature is usually not encoded in
English tagsets.

See also the related feature of [Animacy]().

African languages have an analogous feature of noun classes: there
might be separate grammatical categories for flat objects, long thin
objects etc. African noun classes are not covered in the current
proposal because none of the tagsets on which the proposal is based
are for a language with noun classes. They might be added in future.

### `Masc`: masculine gender

Nouns denoting male persons are masculine. Other nouns may be also
grammatically masculine, without any relation to sex.

#### Examples

* [cs] _<b>hrad</b>_ "castle"

### `Fem`: feminine gender

Nouns denoting female persons are feminine. Other nouns may be also
grammatically feminine, without any relation to sex.

#### Examples

* [de] _<b>Burg</b>_ "castle"

### `Neut`: neuter gender

Some languages have only the masculine/feminine distinction while
others also have this third gender for nouns that are neither
masculine nor feminine (grammatically).

#### Examples

* [cs] _<b>dítě</b>_ "child"

### `Com`: common gender

Some languages do not distinguish masculine/feminine most of the time
but they do distinguish neuter vs. non-neuter (Swedish neutrum /
utrum). The non-neuter is called common gender.

Note that it could also be expressed as a combined value
`Gender=Fem,Masc`. Nevertheless we keep `Com` also as a separate
value. Combined feature values should only be used in exceptional,
undecided cases, not for something that occurs systematically in the
grammar. Language-specific extensions to these guidelines should
determine whether the `Com` value is appropriate for a particular
language.

Note further that the `Com` value is not intended for cases where
we just cannot derive the gender from the word itself (without seeing the context),
while the language actually distinguishes `Masc` and `Fem`.
For example, in Spanish, nouns distinguish two genders, masculine and feminine, and
every noun can be classified as either `Masc` or `Fem`. Adjectives are supposed to
agree with nouns in gender (and number), which they typically achieve by alternating _-o / -a._
But then there are adjectives such as _grande_ or _feliz_ that have only one form for both genders.
So we cannot tell whether they are masculine or feminine unless we see the context.
Yet they are either masculine or feminine (feminine in _una ciudad grande,_ masculine in _un puerto grande)._
Therefore in Spanish we should not tag _grande_ with `Gender=Com`.
Instead, we should either drop the gender feature entirely
(suggesting that this word does not inflect for gender)
or tag individual instances of _grande_ as either masculine or feminine, depending on context.

Mood is a feature that expresses modality and subclassifies finite
verb forms.

### `Ind`: indicative

The indicative can be considered the default mood. A verb in
indicative merely states that something happens, has happened or will
happen, without adding any attitude of the speaker.

#### Examples

* [cs] _<b>Studuješ</b> na univerzitě._ "<b>You study</b> at the
  university."
* [de] _<b>Du studierst</b> an der Universität._ "<b>You study</b> at
  the university."

### `Imp`: imperative

The speaker uses imperative to order or ask the addressee to do the
action of the verb.

#### Examples

* [cs] _<b>Studuj</b> na univerzitě!_ "<b>Study</b> at the university!"
* [de] _<b>Studiere</b> an der Universität!_ "<b>Study</b> at the university!"

### `Cnd`: conditional

The conditional mood is used to express actions that would have taken
place under some circumstances but they actually did not / do not
happen. Grammars of some languages may classify conditional as tense
(rather than mood) but e.g. in Czech it combines with two different
tenses (past and present).

#### Examples

* [cs] <i>Kdy<b>bych</b> byl chytrý, studoval <b>bych</b> na
  univerzitě.</i> "If I were smart I <b>would</b> study at the
  university" (note that only the auxiliary _bych_ is specific to
  conditional; the active participle _byl_ is also needed to
  analytically form the conditional mood, however, it will only be
  tagged as participle because it can also be used to form past tense
  indicative.)

### `Pot`: potential

The action of the verb is likely but not certain. Used e.g. in
Finnish.

### `Sub`: subjunctive / conjunctive

The subjunctive mood is used under certain circumstances in
subordinate clauses, typically for actions that are subjective or
otherwise uncertain. In German, it may be also used to convey the
conditional meaning.

#### Examples

* [fr] <i>Je veux que tu le <b>fasses</b></i> "I want you to do it" lit. <i>I
  want that you it do</i><tt>.Sub</tt>

### `Jus`: jussive

The jussive mood expresses the desire that the action happens. Used
e.g. in Arabic.

### `Qot`: quotative

The quotative mood is used e.g. in Estonian to denote direct speech.

### `Opt`: optative

Used e.g. in Turkish in exclamations like "May you have a long life!"
or "If only I were rich!"

### `Des`: desiderative

The desiderative mood corresponds to the modal verb "want to": "He
<b>wants to come</b>." Used e.g. in Turkish.

### `Nec`: necessitative

The necessitative mood corresponds to the modal verbs "must, should,
have to": "He <b>must</b><b> come</b>." Used e.g. in Turkish.

Negativeness is typically a feature of [verbs](u-pos/VERB),
[adjectives](u-pos/ADJ), sometimes also [adverbs](u-pos/ADV) and
[nouns](u-pos/NOUN) in languages that negate using bound
morphemes. For instance, all Czech verbs and adjectives can be negated
using the prefix _ne-_.  In English, verbs are negated using the
[particle](u-pos/PART) _not_ and adjectives are also negated using
prefixes, although the process is less productive than in Czech _(wise
&ndash; unwise, probable &ndash; improbable)_.

Note that `Negative=Neg` is not the same thing as
[PronType]()`=Neg`. For pronouns and other pronominal parts of speech
there is no such binary opposition as for verbs and adjectives. (There
is no such thing as "affirmative pronoun".)

The negativeness feature could be also used to distinguish response
[interjections](u-pos/INTJ) _yes_ and _no_.

### `Pos`: positive, affirmative

#### Examples

* [cs] _<b>přišel</b>_ "he came"

### Neg: negative

#### Examples

* [cs] _<b>nepřišel</b>_ "he did not come"

Some languages (especially Slavic) have a complex system of
[numerals](u-pos/NUM). For example, in the school grammar of Czech,
the main part of speech is "numeral", it includes almost everything
where counting is involved and there are various subtypes. It also
includes interrogative, relative, indefinite and demonstrative words
referring to numbers (words like _kolik / how many, tolik / so many,
několik / some, a few),_ so at the same time we may have a non-empty
value of [PronType]().  (In English, these words are called
quantifiers and they are considered a subgroup of
[determiners](u-pos/DET).)

From the syntactic point of view, some numtypes behave like adjectives
and some behave like adverbs. We tag them [u-pos/ADJ]() and
[u-pos/ADV]() respectively. Thus the `NumType` feature applies to
several different parts of speech:

* [u-pos/NUM](): cardinal numerals
* [u-pos/DET](): quantifiers
* [u-pos/ADJ](): definite adjectival, e.g. ordinal numerals
* [u-pos/ADV](): adverbial (e.g. ordinal and multiplicative) numerals, both definite and pronominal

### `Card`: cardinal number or corresponding interrogative / relative / indefinite / demonstrative word

Note that in some Indo-European languages there is a fuzzy borderline
between numerals and nouns for _thousand, million_ and _billion._

#### Examples

* [en] _one, two, three_ 
* [cs] _jeden, dva, tři_ "one, two, three"; _kolik_ "how many";
  _několik_ "some"; _tolik_ "so many"; _mnoho_ "many"; _málo_ "few"

### `Ord`: ordinal number or corresponding interrogative / relative / indefinite / demonstrative word

This is a subtype of adjective or (in some languages) of adverb.

#### Examples

* [en] _first, second, third;_ 
* [cs] adjectival: _první_ "first"; _druhý_ "second", _třetí_ "third";
  _kolikátý_ lit. _how manieth_ "which rank"; _několikátý_ "some
  rank"; _tolikátý_ "this/that rank"
* [cs] adverbial: _poprvé_ "for the first time"; _podruhé_ "for the
  second time"; _potřetí_ "for the third time"; _pokolikáté_ "for
  which time", _poněkolikáté_ "for x-th time", _potolikáté_

### `Mult`: multiplicative numeral or corresponding interrogative / relative / indefinite / demonstrative word

This is subtype of adverb.

#### Examples

* [cs] _jednou_ "once"; _dvakrát_ "twice"; _třikrát_ "three times";
  _kolikrát_ "how many times", _několikrát_ "several times";
  _tolikrát_ "so many times"

### `Frac`: fraction

This is a subtype of cardinal numbers, occasionally distinguished in
corpora. It may denote a fraction or just the denominator of the
fraction. In various languages these words may behave morphologically
and syntactically as nouns or ordinal numerals.

#### Examples

* [en] _three-quarters_
* [cs] _půl / polovina_ "half"; _třetina_ "one third"; _čtvrt /
  čtvrtina_ "quarter"

### `Sets`: number of sets of things

Morphologically distinct class of numerals used to count sets of
things, or nouns that are pluralia tantum.

#### Examples

* [cs] _<b>dvoje</b> / <b>troje</b> boty_ "<b>two</b> / <b>three</b>
  [pairs of] shoes"; as opposed to normal cardinal numbers: _dvě / tři
  boty_ "two / three shoes"

### `Dist`: distributive numeral

Used to express that the same quantity is distributed to each member
in a set of targets.

#### Examples

* [hu] _három-három in gyermekenként <b>három-három</b> ezer
  forinttal_ "three thousand forint per child"

### `Range`: range of values

This could be considered a subtype of cardinal numbers, occasionally
distinguished in corpora.

#### Examples

* [en] _two-five_ "two to five" (provided tokenization leaves it as
  one token.)

### `Gen`: generic numeral, i.e. a numeral that is neither of the above

Czech school grammar distinguishes this subclass, which is why it
appears in Czech tagsets. Other Slavic languages may have similar
words but their traditional classification may differ. (Note that
"generic numerals" in Czech grammar also include the `Sets` subclass
mentioned above.)

#### Examples

* [cs] _<b>čtvero, patero, desatero</b>_ (specific forms of four,
  five, ten; they are morphologically, syntactically and stylistically
  distinct from the default forms _čtyři, pět, deset_); _<b>dvojí,
  trojí, čtverý</b>_ (twofold, threefold, fourfold; these are
  morphologically and syntactically adjectives).

`Number` is usually an inflectional feature of [nouns](u-pos/NOUN) and,
depending on language, other parts of speech ([pronouns](u-pos/PRON),
[adjectives](u-pos/ADJ), [determiners](u-pos/DET), [numerals](u-pos/NUM),
[verbs](u-pos/VERB)) that mark agreement with nouns.

### `Sing`: singular number

A singular noun denotes one person, animal or thing.

#### Examples

* [en] _<b>car</b>_

### `Plur`: plural number

A plural noun denotes several persons, animals or things.

#### Examples

* [en] _<b>cars</b>_

### `Dual`: dual number

A dual noun denotes two persons, animals or things.

#### Examples

* [sl] singular _glas_ "voice", dual _<b>glasova</b>_ "voices", plural
  _glasovi_ "voices"
* [ar] singular سَنَةٌ _sanatun_ "year", dual <b>سَنَتَانِ
  _sanatāni_</b> "years", plural سِنُونَ _sinūna_ "years".

### `Ptan`: plurale tantum

Some nouns appear only in the plural form even though they denote one
thing (semantic singular); some tagsets mark this distinction.
Grammatically they behave like plurals, so `Plur` is obviously the
back-off value here; however, if the language also marks gender, the
non-existence of singular form sometimes means that the gender is
unknown. In Czech, special type of numerals is used when counting
nouns that are plurale tantum ([NumType]() = Sets).

Collective or mass or singulare tantum is a special case of
singular. It applies to words that use grammatical singular to
describe sets of objects, i.e. semantic plural. Although in theory
they might be able to form plural, in practice it would be rarely
semantically plausible. Sometimes, the plural form exists and means

This feature typically applies to [pronouns](u-pos/PRON),
[determiners](u-pos/DET), pronominal [numerals](u-pos/NUM)
(quantifiers) and pronominal [adverbs](u-pos/ADV).

### `Prs`: personal or possessive personal pronoun or determiner

See also the [Poss]() feature that distinguishes normal personal
pronouns from possessives. Note that `Prs` also includes reflexive
personal/possessive pronouns (e.g. [cs] _se / svůj;_ see the
[Reflex]() feature).

#### Examples

* [en] _I, you, he, she, it, we, they, my, your, his, her, its, our,
  their, mine, yours, hers, ours, theirs_

### `Rcp`: reciprocal pronoun

#### Examples

* [de] _einander,_ "each other"
* [da] _hinanden_ "each other"

### `Art`: article

Article is a special case of determiner that bears the feature of
[definiteness](Definite) (in other languages, the feature may be
marked directly on nouns).

#### Examples

* [en] _a, an, the_ 
* [de] _ein, eine, der, die, das_ 
* [es] _un, una, el, la_

### `Int`: interrogative pronoun, determiner, numeral or adverb

Note that possessive interrogative determiners (_whose_) can be
distinguished by the [Poss]() feature.

#### Examples: 

* [cs/en] _kdo / who, co / what, který / which, čí / whose, kolik /
  how many, how much, kolikátý / how-maniest_ (ordinal number),
  _kolikrát / how many times, kde / where, kam / where to, kdy / when,
  jak / how, proč / why_

### `Rel`: relative pronoun, determiner, numeral or adverb

Note that in many languages this class heavily overlaps with
interrogatives, yet there are pronouns that are only relative, and in
some languages (Bulgarian, Hindi) the two classes seem to be distinct.

#### Examples: 

* [cs] _jenž, což_ "which", "that" (relative but not interrogative
  pronouns); _jehož_ "whose" (possessive relative pronoun)

### `Dem`: demonstrative pronoun, determiner, numeral or adverb

These are often parallel to interrogatives. Some tagsets might also
distinguish a separate feature of distance (_here / there_; [es] _aquí
/ ahí / allí_).

#### Examples

* [cs/en] _tento / this, tamten / that, takový / such, týž / same,
  tolik / so much, tolikátý / so-maniest_ (ordinal number), _tolikrát
  / so many times, tady / here, tam / there, teď / now, tehdy / then,
  tak / so_

### `Tot`: total (collective) pronoun, determiner or adverb

#### Examples

* [cs/en] _každý / every, everybody, everyone, each, všechno /
  everything, all, všude / everywhere, vždy / always_

### `Neg`: negative pronoun, determiner or adverb

Examples: 

* [cs/en] _nikdo / nobody, nic / nothing, nijaký / no, ničí / no
  one's_ (possessive negative pronoun), _žádný / no, none, nikde /
  nowhere, nikdy / never, nijak / no way_ (lit. “no-how”)

### `Ind`: indefinite pronoun, determiner, numeral or adverb

Note that some tagsets might further subclassify this category to
distinguish "some" from "any" etc. Such distinctions are not part of
universal features but may be added in language-specific extensions.

#### Examples

* [cs/en] _někdo / somebody, něco / something, některý / some, něčí /
  someone's_ (possessive indefinite pronoun), _několik / a few,
  several_ (indefinite numeral/quantifier), _několikátý / “a fewth”,
  “severalth”_ (indefinite ordinal numeral), _několikrát / a few
  times, several times, někde / somewhere, někdy / sometimes, nějak /
  somehow_
* [cs/en] _kdokoli / anybody, cokoli / anything, kterýkoli / any,
  číkoli / anyone's_ (possessive indefinite pronoun), _kdekoli /
  anywhere, kdykoli / any time, jakkoli / anyhow_
* [cs/en] _málokdo / few people, leckdo / quite a few people, kdosi /
  somebody…_

Boolean feature, typically of [pronouns](u-pos/PRON) or
[determiners](u-pos/DET). It tells whether the word is reflexive,
i.e. refers to the subject of its clause.

While many tagsets would have "reflexive" as one of the various
pronoun types, this feature is intentionally separate from
[PronType](), as it is orthogonal to pronominal types.

Note that while some languages also have reflexive verbs, these are in
fact fused verbs with reflexive pronouns, as in Spanish _despertarse_
or Russian _проснуться_ (both meaning “to wake up”). Thus in these
cases the fused token will be split to two syntactic words, one of
them being a reflexive pronoun.

### `Yes`: it is reflexive

Note that there is no `No` value. If the word is not reflexive, the
`Reflex` feature will just not be mentioned in the `FEAT`
column. (Which means that empty value has the `No` meaning.)

#### Examples

* [cs] reflexive personal pronouns: _se, si_; reflexive possessive
  pronoun: _svůj_

Tense is typically a feature of [verbs](u-pos/VERB).
It may also occur with other parts of speech
([nouns](u-pos/NOUN), [adjectives](u-pos/ADJ), [adverbs](u-pos/ADV)),
depending on whether borderline word forms such as gerunds and participles
are classified as verbs or as the other category.

Tense is a feature that specifies the time when the action took /
takes / will take place, in relation to the current moment or to
another action in the utterance. In some languages (e.g. English),
some tenses are actually combinations of tense and
[aspect](Aspect). In other languages (e.g. Czech), aspect and tense
are separate, although not completely independent of each other.

Note that we are defining features that apply to a single word. If a
tense is constructed periphrastically (two or more words,
e.g. auxiliary verb indicative + participle of the main verb) and none
of the participating words are specific to this tense, then the
features will probably not directly reveal the tense. For instance,
[en] _I <b>had been</b> there_ is past perfect (pluperfect) tense,
formed periphrastically by the simple past tense of the auxiliary _to
have_ and the past participle of the main verb _to be_. The auxiliary
will be tagged `VerbForm=Fin|Mood=Ind|Tense=Past` and the participle
will have `VerbForm=Part|Tense=Past`; none of the two will have
`Tense=Pqp`. On the other hand, Portuguese can form the pluperfect
morphologically as just one word, such as _estivera_, which will thus be tagged
`VerbForm=Fin|Mood=Ind|Tense=Pqp`.

### `Past`: past tense / preterite / aorist

The past tense denotes actions that happened before the current
moment. In English, this is the simple past form. In German, this is
the Präteritum. In Turkish, this is the non-narrative past.  In
Bulgarian, this is aorist, the aspect-neutral past tense that can be
used freely with both imperfective and perfective verbs (see also
imperfect).

#### Examples

* [en] _he <b>went</b> home_

### `Pres`: present tense

The present tense denotes actions that are happening right now or that
usually happen.

#### Examples

* [en] _he <b>goes</b> home_

### `Fut`: future tense

The future tense denotes actions that will happen after the current
moment.

#### Examples

* [es] _<b>irá</b> a la casa_ "he/she/it will go home"

### `Imp`: imperfect

Used in e.g. Bulgarian and Croatian, imperfect is a special case of
the past tense. Note that, unfortunately, imperfect tense is not
always the same as past tense + imperfective aspect. For instance, in
Bulgarian, there is lexical aspect, inherent in verb meaning, and
grammatical aspect, which does not necessarily always match the
lexical one. In main clauses, imperfective verbs can have imperfect
tense and perfective verbs have perfect tense. However, both rules can
be violated in embedded clauses.

### `Nar`: narrative

Special case of the past tense, this is the Turkish _miş_-past. The
difference is whether the speaker personally witnessed the action he
is describing, or not.

### `Pqp`: pluperfect

The pluperfect denotes action that happened before another action in
past. This value does not apply to English where the pluperfect (past
perfect) is constructed analytically. It applies e.g. to Portuguese.

Even though the name of the feature seems to suggest that it is used
exclusively with [verbs](u-pos/VERB), it is not the case. Some verb
forms in some languages actually form a gray zone between verbs and
other parts of speech ([nouns](u-pos/NOUN), [adjectives](u-pos/ADJ)
and [adverbs](u-pos/ADV)). For instance, participles may be either
classified as verbs or as adjectives, depending on language and
context. In both cases `VerbForm=Part` may be used to separate them
from other verb forms or other types of adjectives.

### `Fin`: finite verb

Rule of thumb: if it has non-empty [Mood](), it is finite. But beware
that some tagsets conflate verb forms and moods into one feature.

#### Examples

* [en] _I <b>do</b>, he <b>does</b>_

### `Inf`: infinitive

Infinitive is the citation form of verbs in many languages. Unlike in
English, it often has morphological form that is distinct from the
finite forms. Infinitives may be used together with auxiliaries to
form periphrastic tenses (e.g. future tense [cs] _budu <b>sedět</b> v
letadle_ "I will sit in a plane"), they appear as arguments of modal
verbs etc.  In some languages they behave similarly to nouns and are
used as such (similar to the gerund in English).

#### Examples

* [de] _ich muss <b>gehen</b>_ “I must <b>go</b>”

### `Sup`: supine

Supine is a rare verb form. It survives in some Slavic languages
(Slovenian) and is used instead of infinitive as the argument of
motion verbs (old [cs] _jdu <b>spat</b>_ lit. _I-go sleep_).

A form called "supine" also exists in Swedish where it is a special
form of the participle, used to form the composite past form of a
verb.  It is used after the auxiliary verb _ha_ (to have) but not
after _vara_ (to be):

* Simple past: I ate (the) dinner = _Jag åt maten_ (using preterite)
* Composite past: I have eaten (the) dinner = _Jag har <b>ätit</b> maten_ (using supine)
* Past participle common: (The) dinner is eaten = _Maten är äten_ (using past participle)
* Past participle neuter: (The) apple is eaten = _Äpplet är ätet_
* Past participle plural: (The) apples are eaten = _Äpplena är ätna_ 

### `Part`: participle

Participle is a non-finite verb form that shares properties of verbs
and adjectives. Its usage varies across languages. It may be used to
form various periphrastic verb forms such as complex tenses and
passives; it may be also used purely adjectively.

Other features may help to distinguish past/present participles
(English), active/passive participles (Czech), imperfect/perfect
participles (Hindi) etc.

#### Examples

* [en] _he could have <b>been prepared</b> if he had
  <b>forseen</b> it_; _I will be <b>driving</b> home_.

### `Trans`: transgressive

The transgressive, also called adverbial participle, is a non-finite
verb form that shares properties of verbs and adverbs. It appears
e.g. in Slavic and Indo-Aryan languages.

#### Examples

* [cs] _zírali na mne, pevně <b>svírajíce</b> své zbraně_ "they
  stared at me <b>while gripping</b> their guns firmly";
  _<b>udělavši</b> večeři, zavolala rodinu ke stolu_ "<b>having
  prepared</b> the dinner, she called her family to the table"

### `Ger`: gerund

Gerund is a non-finite verb form that shares properties of verbs and
nouns. In English it shares the morphological form with present
participle, which may mean that the tagset will not distinguish it
from the participle.

#### Examples

* [en] _I look forward to <b>seeing</b> you_; _he turns a blind
  eye to my <b>being</b> late_

Voice is typically a feature of [verbs](u-pos/VERB).
It may also occur with other parts of speech
([nouns](u-pos/NOUN), [adjectives](u-pos/ADJ), [adverbs](u-pos/ADV)),
depending on whether borderline word forms such as gerunds and participles
are classified as verbs or as the other category.

For Indo-European speakers, voice means mainly the active-passive
distinction. In other languages, other shades of verb meaning are
categorized as voice.

### `Act`: active voice

The subject of the verb is the doer of the action (agent), the object
is affected by the action (patient).

#### Examples

* [cs] _<b>Napadli</b> jsme nepřítele._ “We <b>attacked</b> the enemy”
  (the active participle _napadli_ can be used to form either past
  tense or conditional mood; here it forms the past tense.)

### `Pass`: passive voice

The subject of the verb is affected by the action (patient). The doer
(agent) is either unexpressed or it appears as an object of the verb.

#### Examples

* [cs] _Jsme <b>napadeni</b> nepřítelem._ “We are <b>attacked</b> by
  the enemy” (the passive participle _napadeni_ is used to form
  passive in all tenses; here it forms the present passive.)

### `Rcp`: reciprocal voice

#### Examples

* [tr] _<b>karıştı</b>_, _<b>tutuştular</b>_

### `Cau`: causative voice

<a href="https://wiki.ufal.ms.mff.cuni.cz/_media/user:zeman:treebanks:ttbankkl.pdf">Documentation</a>
of the METU Sabanci treebank classifies causative as voice (page 26).
Note that this is a feature of verbs. There are languages that have
also the causative case of nouns.

#### Examples

* [tr] _<b>karıştırıyor</b>_ "is confusing"
