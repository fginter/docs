## Morphology

The form / lemma ratio of `SYM` is 1.200000 (the average of all parts of speech is 1.435204).

The 1st highest number of forms (2) was observed with the lemma “%”: _$%, %_

The 2nd highest number of forms (1) was observed with the lemma “CR$”: _CR$_

The 3rd highest number of forms (1) was observed with the lemma “R$”: _R$_

`SYM` occurs with 2 features: [pt-feat/Gender]() (416; 100% instances), [pt-feat/Number]() (416; 100% instances)

`SYM` occurs with 3 feature-value pairs: `Gender=Masc`, `Number=Plur`, `Number=Sing`

`SYM` occurs with 2 feature combinations.
The most frequent feature combination is `Gender=Masc|Number=Plur` (408 tokens).
Examples: _%, US$, R$, CR$, $%, U$_
