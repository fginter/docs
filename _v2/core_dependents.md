# Core Dependents in UD v2

The distinction between core dependents and the rest is fundamental to the whole taxonomy.
Having specific and cross-linguistically consistent guidelines for core dependents is therefore
crucial for putting the whole enterprise on a solid footing. This involves clarifying the
treatment of (among other things) double objects, reflexives, expletives, copula constructions
and valency-changing operations.
Relevant reports from the Uppsala meeting includes:
