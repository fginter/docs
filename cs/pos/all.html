### Definition

Adjectives are words that typically modify nouns and specify their
properties or attributes. They may also function as predicates, as in

_To auto je zelené.&nbsp;_ “The car is green.”

The `ADJ` tag is intended for ordinary adjectives only. See [DET]()
for determiners and [NUM]() for cardinal numerals.

In accord with the UD approach,
adjectival ordinal numerals _(první, sedmý, stopadesátý)&nbsp;_
are tagged as adjectives, although the traditional grammar classifies
them as numerals. They behave like adjectives both morphologically and
syntactically, with the exception that they cannot be compared and
negated.

Most Czech adjectives inflect for
[cs-feat/Gender]() _(velký – velká – velké)&nbsp;_ “big”,
[cs-feat/Number]() _(velký – velcí),&nbsp;_
[cs-feat/Case]() _(velký – velkého – velkému – velkém – velkým),&nbsp;_
[cs-feat/Degree]() _(velký – větší – největší),&nbsp;_ and
[Negation](cs-feat/Negative) _(velký – nevelký).&nbsp;_

### Examples

- _velký&nbsp;_ “big”
- _starý&nbsp;_ “old”
- _zelený&nbsp;_ “green”
- _nejneobhospodařovávatelnějšímu&nbsp;_ “to the most uncultivatable” (the longest Czech word)
- _otcův, matčin&nbsp;_ “father's, mother's” (possessive adjectives)
- _první, druhý, třetí&nbsp;_ “first, second, third”
- _udělaný&nbsp;_ “done” (passive participial adjective, see below)
- _scvrklý&nbsp;_ “shrivelled” (past participial adjective)
- _dělající&nbsp;_ “doing” (present participial adjective, derived from present transgressive)
- _udělavší&nbsp;_ “having done” (past participial adjective, derived from past transgressive)

### Border cases

Passive participles lie on the border between verbs and adjectives.
Core participial forms (ending in consonant or short vowel) are tagged `VERB`.
Long forms are participial adjectives and they are tagged `ADJ`.
For example:

- Verb: _nesen, nesena, neseno, neseni, neseny_ &nbsp;“carried”
- Adjective: _nesený, nesená, nesené, nesení, nesené_ &nbsp;“carried”

Their meaning is almost identical but the usage slightly varies.
Both groups can be used in nominal predication with [copula](cs-dep/cop).
Only true participles (verbs) can be used to form the passive voice
(but it may be sometimes difficult to distinguish from copula constructions, see [AUX]()).
On the other hand, the participial adjectives inflect for case and thus
can modify nouns.

There is an analogy with some adjectives that preserved so called nominal (short) forms.
And these adjectives are not derived from verbs. Example:

- Short (nominal) forms: _stár, stára, stáro_ &nbsp;“old”
- Normal (pronominal) forms: _starý, stará, staré_ &nbsp;“old”

Here both groups are `ADJ`. The nominal forms are used in predication,
the standard forms both in predication and to modify nouns.

	<div property="rdfs:comment">

### Definition

Czech has only prepositions but no postpositions or circumpositions.
They occur before a complement noun phrase
(noun, pronoun)
and they form a single structure with the complement to express its
grammatical and semantic relation to another unit within a clause.

Some prepositions take the form of fixed multiword expressions, e.g.
_na rozdíl od&nbsp;_ “in contrast to”, _v&nbsp;souvislosti s&nbsp;_
“in connection with”. The
component words are then still tagged according to their basic use
(_na&nbsp;_ is `ADP`, _rozdíl&nbsp;_ is [NOUN](), etc.) and their status as
multiword expressions are accounted for in the syntactic annotation.

### Examples

- _v&nbsp;_ “in, at”
- _k&nbsp;_ “to”
- _během&nbsp;_ “during”

	<h2><code property="oliasystem:hasTag" lang="">ADV</code>: <div property="rdfs:label">adverb</div></h2>
	<div property="rdfs:comment">

### Definition

Adverbs are words that typically modify [verbs](VERB) for such
categories as time, place, direction or manner. They may also modify
[adjectives](ADJ) and other adverbs, as in _<b>velmi významně</b>&nbsp;_ “very significantly” or
_<b>prokazatelně</b> chybný&nbsp;_ “provably wrong”.

There is a closed subclass of _pronominal adverbs_ that refer to
circumstances in context, rather than naming them directly; similarly
to pronouns, these can be categorized as interrogative, relative,
demonstrative etc. Pronominal adverbs also get the `ADV`
part-of-speech tag but they are differentiated by additional features.

In accord with the UD approach,
adverbial ordinal numerals _(poprvé, posedmé, postopadesáté)&nbsp;_
are tagged `ADV`, although the traditional grammar classifies
them as numerals.
The same holds for multiplicative numerals
_(jednou, sedmkrát, stopadesátkrát).&nbsp;_

Note that Czech transgressives (also called adverbial participles)
are tagged [VERB](), not `ADV`.

### Examples

- _velmi&nbsp;_ “very”
- _dobře&nbsp;_ “well”
- _přesně&nbsp;_ “exactly”
- _zítra&nbsp;_ “tomorrow”
- _nahoru, dolů&nbsp;_ “up, down”
- ordinal numeral adverbs: _poprvé, podruhé, potřetí&nbsp;_ “for the first time, for the second time, for the third time”
- multiplicative numeral adverbs: _jednou, dvakrát, třikrát&nbsp;_ “once, twice, three times”
- interrogative adverbs: _kde, kam, kdy, jak, proč&nbsp;_ “where, where to, when, how, why”
- demonstrative adverbs: _tady, tam, teď, tehdy, tak&nbsp;_ “here, there, now, then, so”
- indefinite adverbs: _někde, někam, někdy, nějak&nbsp;_ “somewhere, to somewhere, sometime, somehow”
- total adverbs: _všude, vždy&nbsp;_ “everywhere, always”
- negative adverbs: _nikde, nikdy&nbsp;_ “nowhere, never”

	<h2><code property="oliasystem:hasTag" lang="">AUX</code>: <div property="rdfs:label">auxiliary verb</div></h2>
	<div property="rdfs:comment">

### Definition

The only truly auxiliary verb in Czech is _být_ “to be”,
and its variant (with separate lemma) _bývat_ “to usually be”.
It accompanies the lexical verb of a verb phrase and expresses
grammatical distinctions not carried by the lexical verb.

### Examples

- Future tense. Finite future form of _být_ is combined with infinitive
  of the lexical verb. The auxiliary expresses person, number and tense:
  _<b>budu</b> dělat_ “I will do”,
  _<b>budeš</b> dělat_ “you will do”,
  _<b>budou</b> dělat_ “they will do”.
  Note that a limited set of verbs can form future morphologically, without
  the auxiliary.

- Past tense in the first and second person.
  Finite present form of _být_ is combined with past participle
  of the lexical verb. The auxiliary expresses person and number,
  the participle expresses gender and number:
  _dělal <b>jsem</b>_ “I did.`Masc`”,
  _dělala <b>jsem</b>_ “I did.`Fem`”,
  _dělal <b>jsi</b>_ “you did.`Masc`”,
  _dělali <b>jsme</b>_ “we did.`Masc`”.

- Conditional mood.
  Conditional form (historically aorist) of _být_ is combined with past participle
  of the lexical verb. The auxiliary expresses person and number,
  the participle expresses gender and number:
  _dělal <b>bych</b>_ “I would do.`Masc`”,
  _dělala <b>bych</b>_ “I would do.`Fem`”,
  _dělal <b>bys</b>_ “you would do.`Masc`”,
  _dělali <b>bychom</b>_ “we would do.`Masc`”.

- Passive voice.
  A form of _být_ (in various tenses and moods or in the infinitive) is combined with
  passive participle
  of the lexical verb. The auxiliary expresses person, number, tense and mood,
  the participle expresses gender, number and voice:
  _<b>je</b> udělán_ “he is done”,
  _<b>bude</b> udělán_ “he will be done”,
  _<b>byl</b> udělán_ “he was done”,
  _<b>byl by</b> udělán_ “he would be done”,
  _<b>buď</b> udělán_ “be done”,
  _<b>být</b> udělán_ “to be done”.

Note that the verb _být_ will not be tagged `AUX` if it is used as
[copula](cs-dep/cop) (_Moje auto <b>je</b> nové._ “My car <b>is</b> new.”)
or as a content verb (_V&nbsp;Praze <b>je</b> nové divadlo._ “There <b>is</b> a new theatre in Prague.”)
It will be tagged [VERB]() in these cases.
It is also possible that an auxiliary _<b>být</b>_ modifies a lexical _být_
(_V&nbsp;Praze <b>by</b> bylo nové divadlo._ “There <b>would</b> be a new theatre in Prague.”)

Note that the passive participle may be also used as nominal predicate with copula.
Hence it may be difficult to distinguish a passive construction from a copula construction.
The former focuses on the process while the latter emphasizes the result.

- Passive: _Smlouva <b>byla</b>.`AUX` podepsána v&nbsp;Bílém domě._ &nbsp; “The contract was signed in the White House.”
- Copula: _Smlouva <b>byla</b>.`VERB` podepsána červeným inkoustem._ &nbsp; “The contract was signed in red ink.”

### Modal verbs are not auxiliaries

Czech modal verbs are not considered auxiliary and they are tagged `VERB`,
in accord with the annotation in the Prague Dependency Treebank.
Their behavior is only slightly different from other content verbs.

### Constructions with _mít_ and passive participle

There is a construction parallel to the perfect tenses of Germanic and Romance languages:
_mít_ “to have” + neuter singular passive participle, e.g. _mít (něco) uděláno_ “to have (something) done”.
They can also apply to intransitive verbs: _mít vyhráno_ “to have won”.
Sometimes the verb _mít_ shares the subject (actor) with the participle,
but in other contexts such relation is not guaranteed: _mít (někde něco) napsáno_ “to have (something) written (somewhere)”.
None of these constructions is considered a separate tense in the Czech grammar and the verb _mít_
is not analyzed as auxiliary.

### Definition

A coordinating conjunction is a word that links words or larger
constituents without syntactically subordinating one to the other and
expresses a semantic relationship between them.

For _subordinating conjunctions,_ see [SCONJ]().

### Examples

- _a&nbsp;_ “and”
- _nebo&nbsp;_ “or”
- _ale&nbsp;_ “but”

	<h2><code property="oliasystem:hasTag" lang="">DET</code>: <div property="rdfs:label">determiner</div></h2>
	<div property="rdfs:comment">

### Definition

Determiners are words that modify [nouns](NOUN) or noun phrases and
express the reference of the noun phrase in context. That is, a
determiner may indicate whether the noun is referring to a definite or
indefinite element of a class, to a closer or more distant element, to
an element belonging to a specified person or thing, to a particular
number or quantity, etc.

An important point to note is that the traditional grammar of Czech does not
define determiners as a separate word class. Czech does not have articles.
Most determiners are traditionally called pronouns; that is, an UD-conformant
annotation of Czech must distinguish between substantive pronouns (UD tag [PRON]())
and attributive pronouns (UD tag `DET`).

Also note that the `DET` tag includes (pronominal) _quantifiers_ (words
like _mnoho, málo&nbsp;_ “many, few”), which the traditional grammar classifies
as a special subclass of numerals. However,
_cardinal numerals_ in the narrow sense _(jeden, pět, sto)_ are not
tagged `DET` even though some authors would include them in
quantifiers. Cardinal numbers have their own tag [NUM]().

### Conversion from the Prague Dependency Treebank

Since the PDT tagset (like all other Czech tagsets) does not distinguish
substantive and attributive pronouns, morphological tags alone are not enough
to find the correct universal POS tag.
Morphological rules could help, as the inflection patterns of some pronouns
bear similarities to adjectival inflection; nevertheless, there will be other
cases that cannot be solved this way.
We have to examine the dependency tree.
If a pronoun modifies a noun, it should be tagged `DET`.
Otherwise it is `PRON`.
As a result, all words that can be tagged `DET` can also be tagged `PRON`,
but some words can only be tagged `PRON`.
(We cannot recognize cases where the pronoun is in fact attributive, but the
modified noun has been elided and is not represented in the tree.)

For instance, _tohle&nbsp;_ “this” is either pronoun
_(<b>Tohle</b> jsem viděl včera.&nbsp;_ “I saw <b>this</b> yesterday.”)
or determiner
_(<b>Tohle</b> auto jsem viděl včera.&nbsp;_ “I saw <b>this</b> car yesterday.”)

### Examples

- possessive determiners: _můj, tvůj, jeho, její, náš, váš, jejich&nbsp;_ “my, your, his, her, our, your, their”
- reflexive possessive determiner: _svůj&nbsp;_ “one's own”
- demonstrative determiners: _tohle&nbsp;_ as in _<b>Tohle</b> auto jsem viděl včera.&nbsp;_ “I saw <b>this</b> car yesterday.”
- interrogative determiners: _který&nbsp;_ as in _<b>Které</b> auto se ti líbí?&nbsp;_ “<b>Which</b> car do you like?”
- relative determiners: _který&nbsp;_ as in _Zajímá mě, <b>které</b> auto se ti líbí.&nbsp;_ “I wonder <b>which</b> car you like.”
- relative possessive determiner: _jehož&nbsp;_ “whose”
- indefinite determiners: _nějaký, některý_
- total determiners: _každý, všechen_
- negative determiners: _žádný&nbsp;_ as in _Nemáme <b>žádná</b> auta.&nbsp;_ “We have <b>no</b> cars available.”

	<h2><code property="oliasystem:hasTag" lang="">INTJ</code>: <div property="rdfs:label">interjection</div></h2>
	<div property="rdfs:comment">

### Definition

An interjection is a word that is used most often as an exclamation or
part of an exclamation. It typically expresses an emotional reaction,
is not syntactically related to other accompanying expressions, and
may include a combination of sounds not otherwise found in the
language.

As a special case of interjections, we recognize feedback particles
such as _ano_, _jo_, _ne_, etc.
Note that these words are considered particles in the PDT tagset
and have to be retagged during the conversion process.

### Examples

(Note that no direct translation of interjections is possible.
The approximate translations below are for orientation purposes and they
cannot serve to judge the part of speech from the English perspective.)

- _ach&nbsp;_ “oh”
- _pink&nbsp;_
- _inu&nbsp;_ “well”
- _hle&nbsp;_ “look”
- _proboha&nbsp;_ “for God's sake”

## Diffs

### Prague Dependency Treebank

At present the UD-conversion of PDT keeps the PDT convention on tagging
the response words (“yes, no”) as particles.
Automatic conversion would not be straightforward because the negative particle
_ne_ is sometimes used as the response particle/interjection (English “no”)
and sometimes as a free negative morpheme (English “not”).
These two usages would have to be distinguished and only the first one
converted to interjection.

### Definition

Nouns are a part of speech typically denoting a person, place, thing,
animal or idea.

The `NOUN` tag is intended for common nouns only. See [PROPN]() for
proper nouns and [PRON]() for pronouns.

Czech nouns have the lexical feature [cs-feat/Gender]().
Furthermore, the nouns inflect for [cs-feat/Number]() and [cs-feat/Case]().

A verbal noun can be derived productively from almost every verb
(e.g. _dělat_&nbsp; “to do” → _dělání_&nbsp; “doing”).
While in other languages a corresponding form may be called gerund and tagged [VERB](),
in Czech it is tagged `NOUN`. It has always the neuter gender and the full
number-case inflectional paradigm.

### Examples

- _dívka_&nbsp; “girl”
- _kočka_&nbsp; “cat”
- _strom_&nbsp; “tree”
- _vzduch_&nbsp; “air”
- _krása_&nbsp; “beauty”
- _plavání_&nbsp; “swimming”

### Definition

A numeral is a word, functioning most typically as a determiner,
adjective or pronoun, that expresses a number and a relation to the
number, such as quantity, sequence, frequency or fraction.

Note that cardinal numerals are covered by `NUM` whether they are used
as determiners or not (as in _Windows <b>7</b>_) and whether they
are expressed as words _(čtyři)_, digits _(4)_ or Roman numerals
_(IV)_.

Czech grammar distinguishes several subclasses of _pronominal numerals (quantifiers):_
interrogative and relative _(kolik&nbsp;_ “how many”);
demonstrative _(tolik&nbsp;_ “this many”);
indefinite _(několik, mnoho, málo&nbsp;_ “several, many, few”).
These words behave similarly to (most) cardinal numbers,
e.g. they require that the counted noun phrase be in genitive.
They are not similar to adjectives (unlike their English counterparts).
However, in accord with the UD standard, they should be tagged [DET](), not `NUM`.

In addition, several types of (non-pronominal) numerals, such as ordinal
numerals and multiplicative numerals, are tagged [ADJ]() or [ADV](), based on
their syntactic and morphological behavior.

### Examples

- _0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 2014, 1000000, 3.14159265359_
- _I, II, III, IV, V, MMXIV_
- _jeden, dva, tři, čtyři, pět, sedmdesát&nbsp;_ “one, two, three, four, five, seventy”
- _polovina, třetina, čtvrtina, pětina&nbsp;_ “one-half, one third, quarter, one fifth”: denominators of fractions constitute a separate class of cardinal numerals.
- _čtvero, patero&nbsp;_ “four, five” (These are special forms, so-called generic numerals. They are used rarely, in literary or archaic style.)
- _jedny, dvoje, troje, čtvery, patery, sedmdesátery&nbsp;_ “one set of, two sets of, three sets of, four sets of, five sets of, seventy sets of”

### Counterexamples

- _první, druhý, třetí&nbsp;_ “first, second, third”: adjectival ordinal numerals. They are tagged [ADJ](), and the [cs-feat/NumType]() feature reveals their semantic relation to numbers.
- _poprvé, podruhé, potřetí&nbsp;_ “for the first time, for the second time, for the third time”: adverbial ordinal numerals. They are tagged [ADV](), and the [cs-feat/NumType]() feature reveals their semantic relation to numbers.
- _jednou, dvakrát, třikrát&nbsp;_ “once, twice, three times”: multiplicative numerals. They are tagged [ADV](), and the [cs-feat/NumType]() feature reveals their semantic relation to numbers.
- _dvojí, trojí, čtverý, paterý, sedmdesáterý&nbsp;_ “twofold, three kinds of, four kinds of, five kinds of, seventy kinds of”: generic numerals. They are tagged [ADJ]().
- _dvojice, trojice, čtveřice&nbsp;_ “pair, triplet, foursome”: n-tuples _(n-tice)&nbsp;_ are not considered numerals in the Czech grammar. They are tagged [NOUN]().
- _jednička, dvojka, trojka, čtyřka, pětka&nbsp;_ “number one, number two, number three, number four, number five”: names of numbers, or of objects identified by the number (e.g. of a bus route). They are not considered numerals and they are tagged [NOUN]().
- _tisíc, milión, miliarda, bilión&nbsp;_ “thousand, million, billion, trillion”: words for large quantities are ambiguous between cardinal numerals (tagged `NUM`) and nouns.
  If they inflect as nouns, they are tagged [NOUN](); but the borderline is fuzzy.
  For instance, in phrases like _<b>tisíce</b> lidí demonstrovaly v&nbsp;ulicích&nbsp;_ (“<b>thousands</b> of people demonstrated in the streets”),
  _tisíce&nbsp;_ is a noun.
  In numeric expressions, e.g. _110 <b>tisíc</b> dolarů&nbsp;_ (“110 <b>thousand</b> dollars”), it is a cardinal numeral.

### Definition

Particles are function words that must be associated with another word
or phrase to impart meaning and that do not satisfy definitions of
other universal parts of speech (e.g. [adpositions](ADP),
[coordinating conjunctions](CONJ), [subordinating conjunctions](SCONJ)
or [auxiliary verbs](AUX)).  Particles may encode grammatical
categories such as negation, mood, tense etc. Czech particles are
not inflected.

Note that response words such as _ano, jo&nbsp;_ “yes”, _ne&nbsp;_ “no”, etc.
are considered particles in the PDT tagset but they should be retagged
as interjections under the UD standard. Also note that _ne&nbsp;_ can be
used in two ways, one would be translated as English “no” and the other as “not”.
Only the former should become interjection, while the latter will stay a particle.

### Examples

- Sentence modality: _<b>ať</b>, <b>kéž</b>, <b>nechť</b>&nbsp;_ (“<b>Let's</b> do it!” “<b>If only</b> I could do it over.” “<b>May you</b> have an enjoyable stay!”)
- _jen&nbsp;_ “just, only” <!-- 2125 occurrences, the most frequent particle. Strange: its partial synonym _pouze_ is tagged as adverb! -->
- _až&nbsp;_ “only, as late as, even, up to” <!-- Ambiguous: it could be also a conjunction. 1156 occ. TT, 570 J^, 96 J,. -->
  Use case: _až po stovky tisíc let&nbsp;_ “up to hundreds of thousands of years”
- _asi&nbsp;_ “about, roughly, maybe” <!-- All 846 occurrences are tagged as particles. -->

## Diffs

### Prague Dependency Treebank

- _li&nbsp;_ “if”: This is an encliticized morpheme that functions as subordinating conjunction but it always immediately follows
  the predicate of the subordinate clause.
  For example: _Nebude-<b>li</b> pršet, nezmoknem.&nbsp;_
  lit. _Will-not-<b>if</b> rain, we-will-not-get-wet.&nbsp;_
  “We will not get wet if it does not rain.”
  PDT tags the _li&nbsp;_ morpheme as particle and it is currently kept so in the UD conversion
  but it might be changed to `SCONJ` in the future releases.

- At present the UD-conversion of PDT keeps the PDT convention on tagging
  the response words (“yes, no”) as particles.
  Automatic conversion would not be straightforward because the negative particle
  _ne_ is sometimes used as the response particle/interjection (English “no”)
  and sometimes as a free negative morpheme (English “not”).
  These two usages would have to be distinguished and only the first one
  converted to interjection.

	<div property="rdfs:comment">

### Definition

Pronouns are words that substitute for [nouns](NOUN) or noun phrases,
whose meaning is recoverable from the linguistic or extralinguistic
context.

Pronouns under this definition function like nouns. Note that
Czech grammar traditionally extends the term _pronoun_ to words that
substitute for [adjectives](ADJ). Such words are not tagged `PRON`
under our universal scheme. They are tagged as [determiners](DET) in
order to annotate the same thing same way across languages.

For instance, _tohle&nbsp;_ “this” is traditionally called pronoun in
Czech grammar, regardless of context (the notion of determiners does
not exist in Czech grammar). To make the annotation parallel across
languages, it should be now tagged `PRON` in _<b>Tohle</b> jsem viděl
včera.&nbsp;_ “I saw <b>this</b> yesterday.” and `DET` in
_<b>Tohle</b> auto jsem viděl včera.&nbsp;_ “I saw <b>this</b> car yesterday.”

### Examples

- personal pronouns: _já, ty, on, ona, ono, my, vy, oni, ony&nbsp;_ “I, you, he, she, it, we, you, they, they”
- reflexive pronouns: _sebe, se, sobě, si, sebou&nbsp;_ “oneself”
- demonstrative pronouns: _tohle&nbsp;_ as in _<b>Tohle</b> jsem viděl včera._ “I saw <b>this</b> yesterday.”
- interrogative pronouns: _kdo, co&nbsp;_ “who, what” as in _<b>Co</b> si myslíš?&nbsp;_ “<b>What</b> do you think?”
- relative pronouns: _kdo, co&nbsp;_ “who, what” as in _Zajímalo by mě, <b>co</b> si myslíš.&nbsp;_  “I wonder <b>what</b> you think.”
- indefinite pronouns: _někdo, něco&nbsp;_ “somebody, something”
- total pronouns: _každý, všichni&nbsp;_ “everybody, all”
- negative pronouns: _nikdo, nic&nbsp;_ “nobody, nothing”

	<h2><code property="oliasystem:hasTag" lang="">PROPN</code>: <div property="rdfs:label">proper noun</div></h2>
	<div property="rdfs:comment">

### Definition

A proper noun is a noun that is the name
of a specific individual, place, or object.
Czech proper nouns are always written starting with an uppercase letter.
Note that names of days of week
_(pondělí, úterý, středa, čtvrtek, pátek, sobota, neděle)&nbsp;_
and names of months
_(leden, únor, březen, duben, květen, červen, červenec, srpen, září, říjen, listopad, prosinec)&nbsp;_
are not written capitalized (unlike in English)
and are not considered proper nouns.

Single-word named entities should be tagged `PROPN` even if they originate
from a common noun _(Zajíc, Huť)&nbsp;_ or an adjective _(Veselý, Teplá).&nbsp;_
Even if they were originally adjectives and inflect according to adjectival
paradigms, they behave syntactically as nouns. For instance, _Teplá&nbsp;_
(a river and city in western Bohemia) is originally feminine form of the
adjective _teplý&nbsp;_ “warm” but as a geographical name, it is a noun.
It denotes a concrete location (rather than a property of somebody/something)
and its feminine gender is fixed (while adjectives have forms in all three
genders).

Note that names of languages _(čeština, angličtina)_
and adjectives derived from geographical names _(český, anglický&nbsp;_ “Czech, English”)
are written in lowercase and are not tagged `PROPN`.

Personal names are typically treated as a sequence of proper nouns
(one or more given names and one or more surnames).
If the name contains prepositions, conjunctions or articles (foreign names
and old Czech names), these are tagged as `ADP`, `CONJ` and `DET`,
respectively.

Czech (and other Slavic) multi-word named entities have internal syntactic
structure, which is preserved in the annotation. The headword is always noun
and there may be other nouns involved. They will be tagged either `PROPN` or
`NOUN` and possible ambiguities must be resolved individually.
Modifying adjectives are never tagged `PROPN`. Even if an adjective is the
first word of a multi-word name, and thus it starts with an uppercase letter,
it is still tagged `ADJ`.
Similarly, function words in named entities retain their normal tags.
These rules are less strict for foreign named entities where the original
part of speech is hidden for a Czech speaker.

### Examples

- _<b>Bečov</b>_.`PROPN` _nad_.`ADP` _<b>Teplou</b>_.`PROPN` is a city. _Bečov&nbsp;_ is the head
  and the _nad Teplou&nbsp;_ part refers to the river flowing through the city,
  to distinguish it from other Bečovs.
- _Červený_.`ADJ` _<b>Újezd</b>_.`PROPN` is a village. _Újezd&nbsp;_ is the head and it is
  tagged `PROPN` although it originates in the common noun _újezd&nbsp;_ “district, riding”.
  There are many locations named _Újezd&nbsp;_ and the noun is perceived as a proper
  noun in current Czech. _Červený&nbsp;_ is an adjective meaning “red” and it is
  tagged `ADJ`.
- _Červená_.`ADJ` _řeka_.`NOUN` “Red River”. Even though the two words
  together are a name of a particular river, _řeka_ is a common noun and is
  tagged as such.
- _Organizace_.`NOUN` _spojených_.`ADJ` _národů_.`NOUN` “United Nations Organization”
  consists of three words, none of which is proper noun. However, the acronym
  _<b>OSN</b>&nbsp;_ “UNO” is a single-token name and is tagged `PROPN`.

### Conversion from the Prague Dependency Treebank

The PDT set of morphological (part-of-speech) tags does not distinguish
common and proper nouns. However, lemmas in PDT contain additional features
that also encode types of named entities. When converting the PDT annotation
to UD, these lemma features are removed, the `PROPN` tag is used and the feature
[cs-feat/NameType]() is added to the universal features to preserve the type.
Only nouns are treated this way.
Foreign adjectives are not converted to `PROPN` despite the fact
that they entered Czech as parts of foreign names and their lemmas contain
the name type feature.

The following table lists the name types together with the most frequent examples.
See <a href="http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/techrep/tr27.pdf">http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/techrep/tr27.pdf</a>,

### Definition

A subordinating conjunction is a conjunction that links constructions
by making one of them a constituent of the other. The subordinating
conjunction typically marks the incorporated constituent which has the
status of a (subordinate) clause.

For _coordinating conjunctions,_ see [CONJ]().

	<div property="rdfs:comment">

### Definition

A symbol is a word-like entity that differs from ordinary words by
form, function, or both.

Many symbols are or contain special non-alphanumeric characters,
similarly to [punctuation](PUNCT).  What makes them different from
punctuation is that they can be substituted by normal words.  This
involves all currency symbols, e.g. _$ 75_ is identical to
_seventy-five dollars_.

Mathematical operators form another group of symbols.

Another group of symbols is emoticons and emoji.

Strings that consists entirely of alphanumeric characters are not
symbols but they may be [proper nouns](PROPN): _130XE_, _DC10_; others
may be tagged `PROPN` (rather than `SYM`) even if they contain special
characters: _DC-10_.
Similarly, abbreviations for single words are not symbols but are assigned the part of speech
of the full form. For example, _Mr._ (mister), _kg_ (kilogram), _km_ (kilometr), _dr_ (doktor)
should be tagged [nouns](NOUN).
Acronyms for proper names such as _OSN_ and _NATO_ should be tagged as [proper nouns](PROPN).

Characters used as bullets in itemized lists _(•, ‣)_ are not symbols,
they are punctuation.

### Examples

- _$, %, §, ©_
- _+, −, ×, ÷, =, &lt;, &gt;_
- :), ♥‿♥, 😝

	<h2><code property="oliasystem:hasTag" lang="">VERB</code>: <div property="rdfs:label">verb</div></h2>
	<div property="rdfs:comment">

### Definition

A verb is a member of the syntactic class of words that typically
signal events and actions, can constitute a minimal predicate in a
clause, and govern the number and types of other constituents which
may occur in the clause.

Note that the `VERB` tag covers main verbs _(content verbs),_
_modal verbs_ and
_copulas_ but it does not cover _auxiliary verbs,_ for which there is
the [AUX]() tag. (Czech modal verbs are not considered auxiliary.)
See the description of `AUX` for more information on the borderline
between `VERB` and `AUX`.

Czech verbs can take the following morphological forms:

- Infinitive (this is the citation form)
- Finite verb (indicative and imperative forms; conditional is constructed periphrastically)
- Past participle (used to construct past and conditional)
- Passive participle (used to construct passive voice; also used separately as an adjective)
- Transgressive (also called adverbial participle)

There are participial forms that are tagged as adjectives ([ADJ]()) rather than verbs.
See below for examples.

A verbal noun can be derived productively from almost every verb
(e.g. _dělat_ &nbsp;“to do” → _dělání_ &nbsp;“doing”).
While in other languages a corresponding form may be called gerund and tagged `VERB`,
in Czech it is tagged [NOUN](). It has always the neuter [cs-feat/Gender]()
and it inflects for [cs-feat/Number]() and [cs-feat/Case]().

### Examples

- _nést_ &nbsp;“to carry”
- _nesu, neseš, nese, neseme, nesete, nesou_ &nbsp;“I carry, you carry, he/she/it carries, we carry, you carry, they carry”
- _nes, nesme, neste_ &nbsp;“carry” (imperative in different persons and numbers)
- _nesl, nesla, neslo, nesli, nesly_ &nbsp;“carried” (past participle in different genders and numbers)
- _nesen, nesena, neseno, neseni, neseny_ &nbsp;“carried” (passive participle in different genders and numbers)
- _nesa, nesouc, nesouce_ &nbsp;“carrying” (present transgressive in different genders and numbers)

### Border cases

There are passive participles as verb forms (`VERB`)
and participial adjectives (`ADJ`). For example:

- Verb: _nesen, nesena, neseno, neseni, neseny_ &nbsp;“carried”
- Adjective: _nesený, nesená, nesené, nesení, nesené_ &nbsp;“carried”

Their meaning is almost identical but the usage slightly varies.
Both groups can be used in nominal predication with [copula](cs-dep/cop).
Only true participles (verbs) can be used to form the passive voice
(but it may be sometimes difficult to distinguish from copula constructions, see [AUX]()).
On the other hand, the participial adjectives inflect for case and thus
can modify nouns.

There is an analogy with some adjectives that preserved so called nominal (short) forms.
And these adjectives are not derived from verbs. Example:

- Short (nominal) forms: _stár, stára, stáro_ &nbsp;“old”
- Normal (pronominal) forms: _starý, stará, staré_ &nbsp;“old”

Here both groups are `ADJ`. The nominal forms are used in predication,
the standard forms both in predication and to modify nouns.

### Definition

The tag `X` is used for words that for some reason cannot be assigned
a real part-of-speech category.

A special usage of `X` is for cases of code-switching where it is not
possible (or meaningful) to analyze the intervening language
grammatically (and where the dependency relation _foreign_ is
typically used in the syntactic analysis).
This rarely applies to the PDT data where many foreign words are tagged with their original
part of speech.

Even if foreign words are tagged `X`, this usage does not extend
to ordinary loan words which should be assigned a normal
part-of-speech. For example, in _Skotové nosí kilt&nbsp;_ “Scots wear kilts”,
_kilt_ is an ordinary [NOUN]().
